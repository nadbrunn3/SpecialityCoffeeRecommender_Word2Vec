Espresso Blend, southern Ethiopia; Bolivia; Brazil.,"Evaluated as espresso. Lush tropical fruit and tart berry dominates with a chocolaty depth that for co-taster Ethan Hill (94) evoked “chocolate-covered raisin and tropical fruit.” Ken (94) for his part cited cleanly sweet alcohol suggestions (“fruity cabernet”), and both remarked on a sweetly tart pineapple top note that carried throughout the profile. For both tasters the mouthfeel was “plush [and] velvety,” the finish a bit drying but still saturated with the fruit and chocolate suggestions.

Both Ethan and Ken (92) found the cup “richly and sweetly tart,” though Ken apparently found the tart character a bit less appealing than did Ethan. Mouthfeel was “plush” (Ethan), the aftertaste deep and tartly complex for both tasters, though again, Ken would probably have appreciated the cup finishing on a slightly rounder note. In three parts milk both found the tart intensity untamed and “bordering on bracing” (Ethan).","50% Colombia, 35% Ethiopia,",,others,medium,Seattle Coffee Works,

Pantheon Blend No.1,Guatemala; West Java; Colombia.,"Evaluated as espresso. Very discreetly and mildly roast-toned. Ken (93) found the hint of roast fine, maybe even refreshing given all of the bright, lighter-roasted espressos he tastes, but Ethan (91) was not entirely happy with the roasty suggestions. Chocolaty and floral yes, but he also found the blend “bittersweet,” “dry”, even “gritty,” and “lacking complexity overall.” The term “dry” found its way into Ken’s notes as well, but nevertheless he appreciated the chocolate, the caramel, the raisin, the flowers and for him a pleasant hint of anise. True, Ethan did fall in line with Ken when it came to sampling the blend in three parts milk, where both found the chocolate and caramel notes appealing and the floral notes surprisingly clear and persistent.",,,others,medium,Starbucks Reserve Roastery,
Division by Zero Espresso,50% Yirgacheffe Ethiopia; 25% Papua New Guinea; 25% Brazil.,"Evaluated as espresso. Although co-taster Ethan Hill (92) and Ken (92) gave this blend the same rating, Ken was a bit more enthusiastic than Ethan. Both agreed it was a crisply bright, floral-toned espresso (honeysuckle and gardenia for Ethan) with a light, silky mouthfeel. Ethan found a sweet corn undertone in the flavor, Ken a brown sugar note. Both were impressed by the flowers in the “refreshingly resonant” finish (Ethan). In three parts milk Ethan felt the floral brightness clashed a bit with the dairy, though the cup remained “quaintly drinkable”.

Ethan’s emphasized flowers and fruit, Ken’s sandalwood and nut, though both cited a fine, elegant dry cacao note.

Top Shelf Espresso,50% Colombia; 50% Ethiopia.,"Evaluated as espresso. Exhilaratingly floral. For Ken (92) the flowers were explicit – rose, lily, lavender – whereas for co-taster Ethan Hill (92) the floral character was indirect, expressed in notes of peach, nectarine and coriander. Both valued a sweetly pungent sandalwood character enveloping the foreground floral/fruit notes, and both described the mouthfeel as silky but quite light and the finish bright and mildly drying.

Along with fruit and flowers Ken identified a brisk roasted cacao-nib note that for him softened to chocolate in an otherwise rather drying finish. In three parts milk Ethan felt the floral character was muted and the acidity too assertive and out of balance; Ken, on the other hand, found the brisk cacao-and-flowers complex rather pleasing in milk.",,,others,medium,Revel Coffee,

The best shots were particularly impressive in three parts whole milk, where they displayed a roundly nuanced milk chocolate.","Peru; Brazil; Ethiopia; Sumatra,",,others,dark,Oro Caffe for the Singolo espresso system,

Sweet finish with a gentle balancing astringency.",,,others,medium,A&E Roastery,
Colombia Tres Santos Micro-Lot Melange, western Colombia,"Very deep, resonant aroma, with distinct floral and cherry-toned coffee fruit notes, buttery chocolate, and a slight, bracing suggestion of fresh-cut cedar. In the cup giddily and sweetly acidy, with continued clear, intense floral notes and a Chardonnay-like fruit. A hint of butter and, as the cup cools, ripe tomato. The cleanly rich finish stiffens just slightly as the cup cools.","Valle de Cauca Department,",,others,medium,Intelligentsia Coffee,

The fundamental flavor complex is a chocolaty coffee fruit with heady complications of vanilla, flowers and honey.",,,others,medium,Don Francisco's Coffee,
Colombia Inza Cauca, western Colombia,"In the aroma distinct semi-sweet chocolate, caramel and floral notes, with a hint of ripe tomato. Quiet but lush in the cup, with floral notes enveloped in a voluptuous milk- chocolate- and caramel-toned fruit that persists in the gently rich finish.","Valle de Cauca Department,",,others,medium,Coffee Emergency,
Colombia La Esperanza, south-central Colombia,"High-toned, delicate aroma, with sweet flowering grass and cherryish coffee fruit notes, hints of flowers, milk chocolate, apple-toned pipe tobacco.

Clean, sweetly tart finish.","Tolima growing region,",,others,medium,Terroir Coffee,
Colombia Pitalito Estate, southern Colombia,"A classically lyric coffee. The aroma is intense and enveloping, with spicy ripe tomato, bittersweet chocolate, caramel, and banana-like fruit notes. The ripe tomato and dark chocolate notes carry into a cup shimmering with sweet, wine-toned acidity and the unusual banana-like fruit notes, which even seem reflected in the pleasant viscosity of the mouthfeel.","San Augustin growing region, Huila Department,",,others,medium,The Roasterie,

Ethiopian Hama Gold Yirgacheffe Natural, south-central Ethiopia,"Intense aroma, very sweet in impression, with round blueberry, fresh leather and cedar notes. In the cup the roast turns the blueberry toward a rich chocolate, but also seems to develop an astringent edge to the cup. In the finish the lovely blueberry chocolate barely makes itself heard above the persistent astringency.","Yirgacheffe growing region, Sidamo Province,",,others,medium,Montana Coffee Traders,
Organic Toraja, Indonesia,"A coffee whose uncompromisingly earthy character requires the same reorientation of conventional taste as do peaty malt whiskies. Distinct moist fallen leaf notes in the aroma with hints of sweet fruit ferment that with some imagination read as chocolate. In the cup the fallen leaf tones turn distinctly humus-like with continued hints of a sort of fermented chocolate. Medium body, syrupy mouthfeel. The chocolate notes persist in the finish, softening and complicating a hardish astringency.","Toraja (formerly Kalosi) growing region, southwestern Sulawesi (formerly Celebes),",,others,medium,Kura Java Coffee,

Black Apron Kirinyaga Kenya,South-central Kenya,"Delicately fruity aroma, sweet cherry with a hint of chocolate. In the cup sweet, rich, surprisingly full-bodied, with a dry, wine-toned black currant fruit and a slight burned undercurrent.

Blueberry dominates the in the richly sweet though slightly astringent finish.",,,others,medium,Saccuzzo Boutique Coffee,
Papua New Guinea Kinjibi Medium Roast,Central Papua New Guinea,"Richly mid-toned aroma with sweet earth notes complicated by hints of caramel, chocolate and Mediterranean herbs. In the cup a lush sweetness envelopes intensified chocolate and caramel notes and continuing sweet earth and pungent herb tones, with a hint of grapefruity citrus. This complexity fades rather quickly in an otherwise pleasant finish. Nominating reader Al Welker cites this coffee as ""very special giving a mellow low acid cup when roasted medium.""",,,others,medium,Orange Roasters,
Smooth Groove (Fair Trade Organic Blend),Not Disclosed,"A wonderfully deeply dimensioned coffee. Low-toned, resonant aroma complicated by vanilla, caramel and chocolate notes. In the cup roundly bittersweet, big-bodied, simple but lush. With patience vanilla and dark chocolate notes re-emerge. The finish is sweet and rich, though marred by a mild but distinct astringency. Reader Steve Prenzlauer nominated The Groovy Mind roasting company generally for its coffee quality and devotion to organic and Fair-Trade principles.",,,others,medium,The Groovy Mind,
Sumatra Dark, Indonesia,"In the aroma the earthy scent of moist fallen leaves and sweet grapefruit, with a hint of semi-sweet chocolate. In the cup I couldn't find the chocolate, but the fresh-turned, leafy earth tones and the sweet grapefruit intensified. The earth tones remain soft and free of hardness in the long, sweet finish. This is one of several Van Houtte coffees cited by reader Carolyn Jones, who simply testifies that Van Houtte has ""awesome coffee!""","Northern Sumatra,",,others,medium,Van Houtte Cafe,
Costa Rica Tres Rios, central Costa Rica,"A big, deep, simple gesture of a coffee. Roundly resonant aroma with fresh-cut cedar and semi-sweet chocolate notes.

Colombia Tres Santos Micro-Lot Almaguer, western Colombia,"Pure yet extravagant notes of coffee fruit and flowers themselves carry with breathtaking simplicity from aroma into the sweetly acidy cup. I don't recall having experienced the taste of the coffee fruit (think sweetly tart cherries) and the voluptuous scent of the coffee flower (jasmine) so distinctly and so intensely. The slightly astringent finish and turn toward ripe tomato as the cup cools reveals that, at this writing, the coffee is perhaps a bit young, but drink it now because tomorrow it will be out the roaster door. Nominated by reader Herman Reichold who calls it ""one of - if not the - best coffees I have had the pleasure to drink.""","Valle de Cauca Department,",,others,medium,Intelligentsia Coffee,
"Hamma Cooperative Yirgacheffe, Fair-Trade Organic", south-central Ethiopia,"The scent of blueberry fills the room simply in the act of grinding this explosively fragrant coffee. Blueberry continues richly to dominate the wet aroma, nuanced by hints of other low-acid fruit - peach perhaps, and chocolate. In the cup the fruit inclines more toward wine and a lush, minty chocolate, but the blueberry reasserts itself in the finish. Only in the long finish is there a hint of the serendipitous ferment responsible for much of this aromatic excitement. Probably as close to a perfect example of this coffee type as this imperfect world allows, tactfully roasted.","Yirgacheffe growing region,",,others,medium,Sacred Grounds Organic Coffee Roasters,

Decaf Pure Mocha Java,not disclosed,"The bittersweet tang of the dark roast almost overwhelms the coffee, but agreeable if subdued wine-toned fruit notes survive. The finish flirts with the burned rubber sensation of faulty roasting, but the innate sweetness of the coffee prevails and turns the dubious taste vaguely but agreeably chocolate.",,,others,medium,Jeremiah's Pick Gourmet Coffee,
Mountain Country Decaf House Blend,not disclosed,"Bright rather than brisk. A classic combination of high-toned sweetness and gently dry acidity, animated by floral top notes. Only a faint touch of greenness or grassiness mars an otherwise fine American-style breakfast cup.",,,others,medium,Coffee Express,
Sumatra Swiss Water Decaf,not disclosed,"A sweet, high-toned coffee with a distinct musty or mildewy edge. The mustiness imparts a spicy, cocoa-like twist to the pruny fruit notes.",,,others,medium,San Alto/Oasis Coffee,

Papua New Guinea – Sigri,not disclosed,"Panelists described a clean-tasting, agreeable coffee that was perhaps too agreeable, low-key to a fault. ""Good balance, but not much to balance,"" complained one panelist. ""Nothing really to grab onto,"" wrote another. Finished well, with a hint of chocolate, and the cup seemed to strengthen in character a bit as it cooled.",,,others,medium,Amcafe,
Papua New Guinea – Mile-High,not disclosed,"This sweet, deep-toned coffee with its pruny fruit notes edging toward chocolate attracted considerable praise, though some panelists expressed ambivalence",,,others,medium,InterAmerican Commodities,
Timor Aifu,not disclosed,"Split vote, split coffee. The yeas responded to a bright, brisk, floral-and-fruit-toned richness with sweet cedar innuendoes. The nays were disturbed by hard, off-tasting undertones, perhaps a baggy mustiness.",,,others,medium,Holland Coffee Group,
Papua New Guinea Organic,not disclosed,"A coffee whose interesting sweet fruit tones (""apricot"" hazarded one panelist) edge into ferment, the overripe-cum-rotten flavor caused by sugars that prematurely ferment in the coffee fruit, tainting the bean inside the fruit. Complicating the ferment is a related off taste that some panelists tolerated and described with terms like ""tobaccoey"" and others condemned as ""animal-like"" and ""skunky."" In short, a promisingly sweet, complex coffee gone wrong.",,,others,medium,Holland Coffee Group,
Papua New Guinea – Arona,not disclosed,A classically bright yet sweet cup shimmering with seductive floral and wine-like fruit notes. This coffee attracted lavish praise from the panel,,,others,medium,Knutsen Coffees,
Java Jampit Estate,not disclosed,"""A sweet, inoffensive little cup of coffee. No bells and whistles here,"" wrote one panelist. At first I was inclined to agree, but this soft, subtle coffee eventually won me over with its relaxed richness and striking lavender-like floral tones. Other panelists agreed. Perhaps no bells and whistles, but some pleasant warbling.",,,others,medium,InterAmerican Commodities,
Timor Maubesse,not disclosed,Very uneven from cup to cup. The best cups,,,others,medium,Holland Coffee Group,
Timor Organic,not disclosed,"An agreeably sweet coffee with pungent bottom notes, but wildly uneven from cup to cup. A grassy, green taste marred some cups; others clearly displayed the overripe-edging-on-rotten taste of ferment. Some combined both problems, in a sort of bouquet of defects.",,,others,medium,Royal Coffee,
Papua New Guinea – Kalanga,not disclosed,"I suspect only a slight astringency in the aftertaste prevented this Papua New Guinea from pushing up near the top of the ratings. Panelists liked its smoky aroma (""brownies baking"" said one), its soft sweetness, and its understated character. Its rather metallic, salty astringency was barely detectable, but, once observed, distracting.",,,others,medium,Royal Coffee,
Papua New Guinea – Purosa,not disclosed,Most members of the panel loved this coffee. Favorite adjectives,,,others,medium,Holland Coffee Group,
Papua New Guinea – Sigri,not disclosed,"Low-key, with a pungent intrigue in the nose that most panelists identified as nut, but which hinted at something more carnal.

House Blend,not disclosed,An understated dark-roast profile,,,others,medium,Nescafé (Nestle USA),
Maxwell House Rich French Roast,not disclosed,"Remarkably sweet, and rather heavy-bodied. The sweetness here is purely a taste sensation, however. No fruity or other aromatic nuances complicate it. The only intrigue is provided by a hint of hardness or mustiness.",,,others,medium,Kraft Foods,
House Blend,not disclosed,"When hot, understated but pleasantly sweet, with a hint of spicy fruit complicating the mildly burned, pungent tones. The aftertaste is unyieldingly bitter, however, and when the cup cools the coffee lands on the palate with a flat, unrelieved, carbon-toned thud.",,,others,medium,Starbucks Coffee,

Breakfast Blend,not disclosed,"A subdued cup, but pleasantly balanced with pungent and sweet tones that together read as prunes, dried fruit or, in a bit of a stretch, chocolate.",,,others,medium,Buena Vista Coffee (Jewel-Osco),
Yuban 100% Colombian,not disclosed,"Sweet yet dryly bright, lightly acidy with shimmers of wine and flowers. As the coffee cools the grace notes settle toward chocolate. Not much body, dimension or staying power, but a lively, balanced cup.",,,others,medium,Kraft Foods,
Folgers Aroma Roasted,not disclosed,"I 'd call this heavy-bodied coffee rich if there was anything to be rich. The aroma is pleasantly sweet, but the cup displays -- quite literally -- no flavor whatsoever, only primary taste sensation, a sort of heavy emptiness with insinuations of bitterness and sweetness.",,,others,medium,Procter & Gamble,
Chock Full O’Nuts,not disclosed,"The aroma is faint and faintly sweet. The cup displays a pruny fruitiness that plays peek-a-boo with a distinctly unpleasant rubbery taste. In the finish the sweetness prevails, though barely.",,,others,medium,Chock Full O'Nuts Coffee,
Original Blend,not disclosed,"Overwhelmingly musty. If you don 't understand musty, imagine the smell (or taste) of old shoes at the bottom of a damp closet. The mustiness is haloed with sweetness when the cup is hot, but as the coffee cools nothing remains except mustiness",,,others,medium,Eight O'Clock Coffee,
French Roast,not disclosed,"This blend expresses the usual bitter-but-sweet paradox of dark-roast coffees with particular intensity. The sweetness is almost sugary and the burned bitterness dramatically sharp. Not much range, development or weight, but the cup does offer a pleasant tickle of fruit and lavender. The bitterness outlasts the sweetness in the aftertaste.",,,others,medium,Trader Joe's,
Dark Roast,not disclosed,"Just enough sweetness to make the smoky, burned tones bittersweet and cocoa-like rather than simply bitter. And just enough lightness and lift to keep the burned tones from smothering the palate.",,,others,medium,Eight O'Clock Coffee,

"Finca La Tacita, Estate Peaberry",not disclosed,"Full yet majestically buoyant.

The Elves Imperial Breakfast Blend,not disclosed,"Dry acidy tones combine nicely with a restrained roasty pungency. Good, deep dimension, but little sweetness to support the deeply tart fruit notes.",,,others,medium,Intelligentsia Coffee,
Malulani Estate,not disclosed,"This intriguing, low-toned coffee is neither balanced nor coherent, but definitely engaging. The rather hard first impression instantly softens and sweetens, revealing odd, richly herbal notes. The herbal notes persist in the aftertaste, haloed by sweetness.",,,others,medium,St. Ives Coffee Roasters,
Jamaican Blue Mountain – Mavis Bank,not disclosed,"Understated, barely felt dry tones animate a roundly balanced cup embellished by teasing hints of deep-toned fruit and a shimmer of flowers. In the rich, long finish the fruit modulates toward chocolate. As the coffee cools a slight flatness mars the profile, perhaps a drying fault. I evaluated this coffee mainly on the basis of its full, lovely balance when hot.",,,others,medium,St. Ives Coffee Roasters,
Christmas Blend,not disclosed,"The earthy tones of the Indonesias dominate, sweet in the nose but dry and cocoa-like on the palate. A hint of winy fruit tries to raise its head above the dry earth and cocoa but subsides into the taciturn briskness of the cup.",,,others,medium,Starbucks Coffee,
Holiday Blend with Spices,not disclosed,"Pleasant and interesting, although to my taste the coffee component is not quite sweet or heavy-bodied enough to completely support the spice. A sharp tickle of pepper and clove with a hint of cinnamon sweetness complicates a straightforward, low-key cup.",,,others,medium,Mountanos Brothers Coffee Company,
Italian Roast,not disclosed,"A pure, classic dark-roast gesture. Unusually full body for a roast this dark",,,others,medium,Java Trading Company,

Turkish Delight,not disclosed,"A big-bodied darkish blend with hints of sweet fruit that doesn 't quite get off the ground. The heart of the coffee remains sweet and full but rather inert. Perhaps best in the long aftertaste, when the sweet tones are freed of the gritty encumbrances of body and texture.",,,others,medium,Caravan Coffee,
Mountain Man Blend,not disclosed,An unusually full body gives the dominating pungency of this extreme dark roast solidity and substance. Some smoky notes and high-toned sweetness survive the rigors of the roast.,,,others,medium,Yosemite Coffee Roasting,

Ethiopian Harrar “Horse”,not disclosed,"Tremendous but balanced range and dimension. The acidity is full, deep, sweet, enveloped in the unifying matrix of the cup.

"Organic Timor Aifu, Vienna Roast",not disclosed,"A dark roast that tip-toes past burned to achieve a smooth, integrated bittersweetness, enlivened by a hint of acidity and a touch of fruit.",,,others,medium,Muddy Waters Coffee,
Paia Blend,not disclosed,"This coffee opens opulently, with a complex, enveloping aroma alive with nutty, spicy, bittersweet tones. In the cup the profile is smoky sweet, discreetly brightened by a touch of acidity. As the cup cools, however, the sweetness fades and the smokiness reveals hard, musty undertones. My rating faded too, from a high of 87 to a final landing at 81.",,,others,medium,Anthony's Coffee,
Ethiopia Harrar,not disclosed,"Smoky, resiny tones turn the Harrar fruit richly winy. In the finish everything softens and sweetens. The cabernet fruit tones deepen toward chocolate and the smoke tones turn toward fresh tobacco.",,,others,medium,Alaska Coffee Roasting Company,
Ethiopia Yirgacheffe,not disclosed,"A light, bright breath of acidity shimmers inside an amazing bouquet of sweet jasmine and darker, woodier fragrances. The cup soars in a delicious, reeling dizziness of flowers, then immediately relaxes into spicy shadows. Somehow, all of the range and complexity remains precariously, elegantly in balance.",,,others,medium,Alaska Coffee Roasting Company,
Mocca Java Blend,not disclosed,"Pungent Sumatra tones wrap around the Ethiopian flowers and Yemen fruit. The deep, aromatic wood tones modulate to a fruity, cherryish chocolate in the finish. The pungency turned slightly flat as the cup cools, slightly shadowing an intriguing and dramatic cup.",,,others,medium,Sweet Maria's Coffee,
Mexican Maya,not disclosed,"Classic vanilla-nut aroma and a solid, authoritatively dry cup, bright but not brassy. Not a lot of nuance, but outstanding range and balance.",,,others,medium,Milagro Coffee y Espresso,
Oakhurst Morning,not disclosed,"A pleasant roast-driven pungency balances a sturdy, assertive acidity. Dry and authoritative. Something seems to be flattening nuance, however. Either the five blend components are canceling one another out or the forceful roast has driven out some aromatics. In any event, more sweetness and lift would make a pleasantly hearty Oakhurst morning even rosier.",,,others,medium,Yosemite Coffee Roasting,

"Guatemalan Antigua, 1999",not disclosed,A promising coffee dried out in the roast. The slightly charred bittersweetness edges toward chocolate but doesn't quite make it. Any remaining nuance appears to have been burned off.,,,others,dark,Milone Bros. Coffee,
Guatemala Huehuetenango ’99,not disclosed,"An exquisitely refined chocolate sensation dominates the profile. The chocolate is at its richest and sweetest in aroma, then turns pleasantly dry in the cup and lingers crisply in aftertaste. This may be a bit of a one-note coffee, but it's a very elegant note.",,,others,dark,Heritage Coffee,
Antigua Bella Carmona ’99,not disclosed,"The bright Latin-American profile is complicated in the aroma by dry, pungently roasty nut tones. The cup displays unusual vegetal tones that reach toward floral, but fall a bit short.",,,others,dark,Oren's Daily Roast,
"Guatemalan El Injerto, 1999",not disclosed,"The powerful acidity is like a whack across the palate. It doesn't allow much else to make an impression, although some cups hinted at a nutty sweetness. Perhaps the robust, dominating acidity is pleasure enough.",,,others,dark,Montana Coffee Traders,
"Guatemalan Antigua, 1999",not disclosed,"A gently bright coffee, sweet and alive with spice and smoke in the aroma and floral innuendo in the cup. The floral tones linger in the aftertaste. Just enough resonance and depth to maintain authority.",,,others,medium,Boyd Coffee,
"Guatemala Fraijanes, 1999",not disclosed,"A rich, rounded acidity dominates with unaffected clarity from aroma through aftertaste. A cup in which nuance is not so much absent as irrelevant to the cup's essential candor.",,,others,medium,Café Del Mundo,
"Guatemala Antigua, 1998",not disclosed,"A classic Latin-American cup, dominated by an austere, powerful, full-throated acidity. The big, acidy profile is both impressive and monolithic, complicated only by barely felt floral tones, a sort of deeply held essence of flowers.",,,others,medium,Barnie's Coffee & Tea,
"Guatemala Antigua Organic, 1999",not disclosed,An almost symphonic coffee. Nuance stretches across the profile,,,others,medium,The Roasterie,
"Guatemala, 1999",not disclosed,"The roast dominates the coffee, burning off sugars and turning the cup dryly pungent, full and hearty but not sweet. Crisp chocolate tones complicate the finish.",,,others,dark,Dunn Bros. Coffee,

"Guatemala, 1998 / 1999",not disclosed,An unusual profile,,,others,dark,Heritage Coffee,
Nicaragua Organic,Nicaragua,"The roast turns the lemony acidity rich and smokily pungent. Not a lot of range or innuendo, but a balanced and satisfying cup.",,,others,dark,Batdorf & Bronson,
Jamaican Blue Mtn Dark Roast,not disclosed,"A clean, sweetly understated acidity complicated by a hint of flowers animates the bittersweetness of the dark roast. Ultimately the bitter tones dominate in finish, however, and intensify as the coffee cools.",,,others,dark,Endless World Coffee,
Kenya,not disclosed,"Rich Kenya wine tones dominate, buoyed by shimmers of citrus and berry. A complex sweetness blooms as the cup cools and the dry wine tones soften. A fine coffee, although I missed the echoing dimension of the very best Kenyas.",,,others,dark,Starbucks Coffee,
Bohemian Blend,not disclosed,"Probably the smoothest, most seamlessly integrated dark-roast blend in the cupping. Preserves distinct acidy tones, but wraps them in dark-roast character, balancing them richly on the cusp between fruity tart and roasty pungent. Softly sweet in finish, without a trace of charred or burned notes.",,,others,dark,Batdorf & Bronson,
Best of Africa Blend,not disclosed,"Strikingly sweet, with virtually no dark-roast bitterness. The sweetness is agreeably complicated by tart berryish or citrusy tones, but overall the profile seems a bit restrained, a touch limited in range and dimension.",,,others,dark,Pannikin Coffee & Tea,
Turkish Blend,not disclosed,"To my palate, one of the finer dark roasts in the cupping. The sweetness is elegantly complex and lemony, lightly rich, almost juicy. A subdued charred bitterness balances the fruity sweetness.",,,others,dark,Pannikin Coffee & Tea,
Kenya,Kenya,"A deep, resonant pungency envelops the Kenya dry wine and tart berry tones, giving them a sexy fresh-sweat twist. This odd, rough-yet-smooth pungency is a Peet's trade mark, and only occasionally found in coffees dark-roasted by competitors. Here it supports without obliterating the citrus and berry freshness of the Kenya.",,,others,dark,Peet's Coffee & Tea,
French Roast,not disclosed,"As usual with most extreme dark-roasted blends sold under the name French roast, no real flavor survives, only competing sensations of bitter and sweet -- in this case inclined more toward the bitter. I preferred this particular ""French roast"" profile over several others owing to the invigorating intensity of the bittersweetness",,,others,dark,Jeremiah's Pick Gourmet Coffee,
Italian Roast,not disclosed,"A fresh citrusy sharpness complicates the dark-roast bittersweetness. The bitter tones intensify in finish, but never completely master the sweetness, which persists pleasantly through aftertaste.",,,others,dark,Starbucks Coffee,
Fogbuster Blend,not disclosed,"A pleasantly charred sweetness, buoyant and almost floral, dominates at first. As the cup cools the sweetness recedes and the bitter side of the dark-roast cup prevails.",,,others,dark,Jeremiah's Pick Gourmet Coffee,
French Roast,Various,"The bittersweet paradox is less intense here than in the Jeremiah's Pick French Roast, with a bit more emphasis on the sweet side of the equation and a hint of dry, pruny fruit. The smoothest body of the eight French roasts I cupped, suggesting that the roast drove fewer fats out of the bean.",,,others,dark,Peet's Coffee & Tea,
Jamaica Blue Mtn:Old Tavern #1,not disclosed,Close to the great Blue Mountains of the past,,,others,medium,Armeno Coffee,
Kenya Decaf,not disclosed,"Sweet, almost juicy, lemon-and-nut-tones carry exhilaratingly from aroma into the cup. Once there, they turn a bit stolid, then darkens toward tobacco in the finish.",,,others,medium,Batdorf & Bronson,
Moka,not disclosed,"When hot, the cup is light-bodied but smooth, with a touch of levitating floral-toned fruit that turns sweetly chocolate in the finish. As the cup cools the fruit deepens toward wine and even more distinctly chocolate tones.",,,others,medium,Kaanapali Estate Coffee,
Hawaiian Kona Extra Fancy,not disclosed,"A dry, powerful, authoritative cup, rich but not sweet. The ringing energy of the acidity and the substantial body are close to monumental, though lovers of delicacy and nuance may be disappointed.",,,others,medium,Armeno Coffee,
Fifth Anniversary Blend,not disclosed,"A blend that in its completeness is a tribute to the blender's art. Solid without drama, displaying excellent range and a fine balance between sweetness and (I would guess) Indonesia pungency. Mouth-filling, close to creamy body, cleanly resounding aftertaste.",,,others,medium,The Roasterie,
Ethiopia Yirgacheffe,not disclosed,Lovely Yirgacheffe character,,,others,dark,Barnie's Coffee & Tea,
Yemen Mocha,not disclosed,"A cup displaying all of the idiosyncrasy and complexity that makes Yemen such a fascinating origin. The aroma is funky, rich, pungent, all haloed by sweetness. The body is rich and buttery. The controversial, slightly composty overtones to the fruit that turn some palates off to Yemen are gently dominated here by the pungent taste of the roast, turning the fruit into a sensation as much tactile as olfactory, a sort of smoky, dry-toned richness.",,,others,medium,Allegro Coffee Roasters,
Kona – Honomalino Extra Fancy, Hawaii,"A more authoritative, richer version of the Honomalino Kona Peaberry. The nose is rounder, the acidity brighter and brisker,the body fuller.

Kona – Honomalino Peaberry, Hawaii,Superb aroma,"Honomalino Estate, Kona, Big Island,",,others,medium,Willoughby's Coffee & Tea,
Colombian Supremo Popayan,not disclosed,"A distinctively sweet, fruity Colombia. The fruit hovers on the edge of ferment, but to my palate remains safely on the lush but chocolate-cherryish side of the defect divide. The nose is perfectly clean",,,others,medium,Green Mountain Coffee Roasters,
Sumatra Decaf,not disclosed,"Distinct lemony tones elevate the profile of this roundly satisfying but rather light-bodied Sumatra. The finish is lively, theaftertaste long and clean.",,,others,medium,Batdorf & Bronson,
Organic CO2 Decaf Peru,not disclosed,"A coffee that rewards deliberation. The sweet nut tones that are the glory of many softer Latin-America coffees run luxuriantly through the profile from aroma to finish, taking on a distinct chocolate cast in the cup. A coffee whose richness reads more as resonance than heaviness.",,,others,dark,Counter Culture Coffee,
Mocha Java Style Blend,not disclosed,"Sweet, deeply dimensioned floral notes dip toward spice and nut in the aroma. The cup is lemony, but it is a complex, deep lemon, modulating toward dry chocolate in the finish. Saved from any hint of candyish sentiment by richly acidy mid-notes.",,,others,medium,Willoughby's Coffee & Tea,
Tchoupitoulas Blend,not disclosed,"A splendid, high-toned cup, soaring but complex. Floral tones whisper at the top of the profile, wine-toned fruit fills out the middle; both float on a base of understated, toasty richness.",,,others,medium,Orleans Coffee Exchange,
Koloa Estate Dark Roast,not disclosed,"A suavely understated dark roast with a tickle of spice and chocolate at its heart. The pungent bite of the dark roast is muted and enveloped in sweetness, the finish rich and chocolate-toned.",,,others,medium,Kauai Coffee Company,
Aged Sumatra,not disclosed,"Considerably more emphatic and complex than the Armeno aged Sumatra, apparently owing to the handling of the roast. The same hardness characteristic of many aged Sumatras of recent years is enveloped here with a soft, almost candy-like sweetness, modulating to a dry, tobaccoish finish. Sweet notes prevail in the aftertaste.",,,others,dark,Allegro Coffee Roasters,
Java Estate,not disclosed,"Not a trace of the twisty pungency of most Sumatras and Sulawesis here. Instead a nut-softening-to-vanilla nose, a clear, assertive floral-toned acidity, even a hint of smoke in the finish. With just a little more dimension and sweetness this coffee would be a knockout.",,,others,medium,Batdorf & Bronson,
Sumatra Mandheling,not disclosed,"A slight pungency immediately melts in cinnamon-tending sweet spice. The solid (though not hard or heavy) profile retains a consistent character from nose through long, resonant aftertaste. The spice simplifies a bit as the cup cools.",,,others,medium,Batdorf & Bronson,
Papua New Guinea Sigri,not disclosed,An unexceptional but comfortable Pacific profile,,,others,medium,Bucks County Coffee,
Sumatra Gayo Mountain,not disclosed,"Another juxtaposition of hard-toned pungency and soft sweetness, although here the sweetness blooms with subtle floral notes in finish and aftertaste. Somewhere in the overlap of hardness and sweetness an additional little nuance emerges, a pleasant spicy tickle.",,,others,medium,Allegro Coffee Roasters,
Organic Timor,not disclosed,"A clean Indonesia profile, meaning the pungency is soft rather than oppressively hard and the balancing sweetness is substantial and fresh. An ingratiating and straightforward coffee, though short on nuance.",,,others,medium,Counter Culture Coffee,
Sumatra Mandheling,not disclosed,"A hard, baggy pungency. A sweet, soft (perhaps floral) sweetness. When the two work together we get an agreeable sweet/sharp taste that suggests chocolate. The sweet subtext prevails pleasantly in the aftertaste.",,,others,medium,Willoughby's Coffee & Tea,
Sulawesi Kalossi DP,not disclosed,"Another coffee in which the hard tones characteristic of many traditionally processed Indonesian coffees are precariously mellowed by an ingratiating sweetness. The combination of (perhaps musty) sharpness and sweetness hints at chocolate, particularly in the finish.",,,others,medium,Allegro Coffee Roasters,
Organic Timor,not disclosed,"A hard pungency dominates the profile, but it's a rather rich, deep-throated hardness, with undertones of dry spice and a shimmer of sweetness. Possibly an over-aggressive roast burned off some of the sugars, imbalancing the cup.",,,others,dark,Heine Brothers Coffee,
Aged Sumatra Mandh. Pawani,not disclosed,"I had difficulty deciding whether to honor the inert hardness of this coffee because it's a deliberately achieved characteristic, or condemn it as a defect because I don't find it a particularly pleasant version of the aged taste. The dominating attribute is an oppressively hard pungency that flattens and simplifies the profile. Only a delicate halo of almost subliminal sweetness lightens the cup.",,,others,medium,Armeno Coffee,
New Guinea Sigri,not disclosed,"A understated but profoundly complex coffee that rewards patience. The nose is restrained, but in the cup a roundly rich pungency is balanced by pronounced sweetness and nuanced by subtle wine tones. The finish is resonant, the aftertaste long, sweet and clean.",,,others,medium,Counter Culture Coffee,
Java,not disclosed,"A powerful sweetness transforms the Indonesia pungency into clear dry chocolate tones, enlivened by a touch of acidy brightness. The chocolate tones hint at spice in finish and aftertaste.",,,others,medium,Barnie's Coffee & Tea,
Kenya AA- Green,not disclosed,"Consensus found the acidity in this Kenya pleasantly fruity and sweet in the nose but disturbingly sharp in the cup and astringent in the aftertaste. Again, a slightly darker roast might help tame the sharpness. A few of us found solace in what struck us as a round, rather richly textured body.",,,others,medium,Tambaya,
Kenya AA – Green,not disclosed,"Pungent, full, deep-throated fruit dominates here. Several panelists called the cup balanced, which I take as praise for the way the acidity animates the profile from the inside rather than screaming off the top. Nevertheless, overall this coffee generated limited enthusiasm. ""Decent,"" wrote one. ""Not the big fruity notes, but drinkable,"" harrumphed another. ""Lacks true East African character,"" complained a third.",,,others,medium,Nyaithee,
Kenya AA – Green,not disclosed,"Ambivalence. Several panelists admired this Keny's understated but richly fruity sweetness, but judging from their scores, remained only mildly impressed by the whole package. ""Sweet undertones; dances nicely on the palate, but with a weird, disjointed rhythm"" wrote one, memorably. ""Thin, lackluster,"" complained another. I found the cup pleasant but underpowered.",,,others,medium,Ngandu,
Kenya AA – Green,not disclosed,"Bright but well-matrixed acidity, full body, and a complex cluster of grace notes elevated the score of this sample. ""Good balance of flavors, excellent complexity, ... fruit, spice, ... tropical woods, cedar with some sweet dark chocolate. [But] fades when cool. Where did all that flavor go?"" For me the flavor went too soon. I missed length and development, and found the smoky, herby notes a touch dissonant. But that's a minority opinion",,,others,medium,Muthewathi,
Kenya AA – Green,not disclosed,"A high score but a relatively low wow quotient. Apparently panelists valued this coffee for its rich balance and deeply matrixed fruit; the body was described variously as full, heavy, and thick. However, several panelists felt the cup was a bit faded, restrained, ""past-croppish."" Perhaps this is an instance when the mid-season timing of the cupping did prejudice the cupping results.",,,others,medium,Marua,
Kenya AA – Green,not disclosed,"This was my personal favorite for its explosion of flowers and fruit and long, chocolate-toned finish. I wasn't alone. I counted two ""wows!"" scrawled on the cupping forms, a significant wow-quotient given the usually restrained disposition of the panel. Although most stopped short of wow, they did register their admiration for this coffee's bright, nuanced fruit and balanced matrix. Only one dissenter",,,others,medium,Kiunyu AA,
Kenya AA – Green,not disclosed,I liked this coffee. For me it displayed the typical strength of fine Kenyas,,,others,medium,Ichamara,
Kenya AA – Green,not disclosed,"This Kenya attracted the highest rating achieved by any coffee since Coffee Review began its panel cuppings. Judging from comments alone it would seem that its bright, vibrant acidity powered it to the top, but I suspect that the ultimate reason it prevailed over other samples in the cupping is its deep, echoing dimension. This coffee didn't just tickle or please the palate, it resonated on it like the stroke of a deliciously humming gong. Minority report",,,others,medium,Gaturiri,
Kenya AA – Green,not disclosed,"The brightly assertive, sweetly fruity acidity that Kenya enthusiasts love is on full display here, cradled by a richly textured body. As a bonus we get the treasured Kenya berry notes, although the panel wasn't sure whether they were blueberry, blackberry, strawberry or just ""berry."" Berries and all, I found this otherwise splendid Kenya a touch shallow in dimension compared to the highest-rated Gaturiri.",,,others,medium,Gatomboya,
Kenya AA – Green,not disclosed,"Most panelists found the acidity too dominating here and the rest of the profile too neutral, making for a sort of one-dimensional Kenya cup. ""A test-tube Kenya,"" complained one. ""Very bright acidity, but not able to pick out other threads,"" wrote another. Finally",,,others,medium,Gathangu,
Zimbabwe – Green, Zimbabwe,"Ambivalence. Most panelists noted a pleasantly fruity, floral sweetness, particularly in the nose, but as the coffee cooled an underlying baggy flatness emerged to drown out the pleasant memories. ""This coffee is like a bitter wind,"" wrote one. ""Cools to grassy flavors."" Two panelists complained that the roast was too light to do justice to the coffee. Perhaps that accounts for the grassy notes, but I don't think that the overall flatness can be attributed to roast.","La Lucie Estate,",,others,medium,La Lucie Estate,
Kenya – Muthewathi AA,not disclosed,"Bright but well-matrixed acidity, full body, and a complex cluster of grace notes elevated the score of this sample. ""Good balance of flavors, excellent complexity, ... fruit, spice, ... tropical woods, cedar with some sweet dark chocolate. [But] fades when cool. Where did all that flavor go?"" For me the flavor went too soon. I missed length and development, and found the smoky, herby notes a touch dissonant. But that's a minority opinion",,,others,medium,Armeno Coffee,
Kenya – Marua AA,not disclosed,"A high score but a relatively low wow quotient. Apparently panelists valued this coffee for its rich balance and deeply matrixed fruit; the body was described variously as full, heavy, and thick. However, several panelists felt the cup was a bit faded, restrained, ""past-croppish."" Perhaps this is an instance when the mid-season timing of the cupping did prejudice the cupping results.",,,others,medium,Armeno Coffee,

Green Coffee: Zambia,not disclosed,"One set of palates identified the problem with this Zambia as roughness and harsh acidity. Others, including me, simply read the coffee as underdeveloped. ""Flat and woody ... no pulse"" said one. ""Tired,"" according to another. Perhaps too many half-ripe cherries carried through to the sample, or perhaps the lightish roast failed to do justice to the coffee. Three of us detected smoky or tobaccoish notes, but none found these tart embellishments particularly attractive.",,,others,medium,Terranova Estate,

Sumatra Mandheling,not disclosed,"When the cup was hot I thought I had hit the Sumatra jackpot, something close to the great Sumatras of pre-Starbucks days, when Sumatra was an exotic secret shared by a handful of professionals and enthusiasts. Rich, burgundy-like fullness, gathering under the back edges of the tongue, with just enough acidity to set off dark tickles and echoes. However, a slightly bitter and salty aftertaste gave away this coffee's weakness, which became abundantly clear as the cup cooled",,,others,medium,Timothy's World Coffee,
Sumatra Mandheling,not disclosed,"Distinctive but limited. The strength of the cup is a powerfully smoky, carbony center with pleasing hints of dry chocolate.

Sumatra,not disclosed,"Another Sumatra with intrigue, but more murky than mysterious.

Espresso di Carlo,not disclosed,"Clean and elegant aroma with a shimmer of vanilla. In the demitasse complex, exciting, but not entirely balanced. The contrast of pungent sharpness and underlying caramelly sweetness is dramatic but stark, and carries the coffee precariously toward a rich but slightly astringent aftertaste.

Brazil,not disclosed,"For me this coffee lacks sufficient sweetness to support its attractive tobacco, spice and floral notes. Sweetness in dry-processed coffees like this one comes from sustained contact of the bean with ripe fruit during drying. The profile-flattening lack of sweetness here may derive from too many green or unripe cherries in the mix.",,,others,medium,Mr. Espresso,

Brazilian,not disclosed,"A dullness, perhaps a shadow defect from rain-interrupted drying, shadows an otherwise splendidly sweet profile. The sweetness, enlivened by spice and chocolate, almost sneaks out from under the hardness at the finish, but never quite makes it. Too bad.",,,others,medium,Ink Coffee,
Brazil Bourbon Santos,not disclosed,"Very sharp, carbony cup, with little richness or sweetness. Both aroma and body seem burned off the coffee by the rather aggressive roast.

Brazil Fazenda Vista Alegre,not disclosed,"A hard, nasty ferment mars an otherwise sweetly rich profile.",,,others,medium,Armeno Coffee,
Brazil Bourbon Santos,not disclosed,"Displays a rich, deeply matrixed acidity reminiscent of the best Sumatras. Although the cup is not quite as sweet and roundly ingratiating at first sip as some others in the cupping, the acidity sustains power as the cup cools, hence the somewhat higher rating for this coffee compared to those with comparable sweetness and body. A slight edginess to the acidity may indicate a scattering of cherries that were close to ferment as the coffee dried, but this shadow fault, if present at all, is so faint that it strikes me as a quibble. A fine coffee well-roasted.",,,others,medium,Armeno Coffee,
Brazil Fancy Bourbon Santos,not disclosed,"Rich with a low-toned, vibrant acidity. The body is creamily smooth, though a touch lighter than the heaviest-bodiedBrazils in the cupping.

Celebration Caffe,not disclosed,"Another holiday coffee distinguished by a dark-roasted, pungent heart.

Guatemala Pure Organic,not disclosed,"A complex, shifty profile. When the cup is hot, explicit vanilla tones with a hovering suggestion of spice are balanced by a deep-toned, rather pungent tartness. As the cup cools the vanilla sweetens toward caramel and the spice turns vaguely fruity. Perhaps all of the spice and pungency adds up to the famous ""smokiness"" often attributed to Guatemalas.",,,others,medium,White Cloud Mountain Coffee,
Nicaragua Segovia,not disclosed,"A solid, no-frills Latin-America acidity dominates the cup. No fruit and very little nuance, although the profile sweetens pleasantly in the finish, rounding toward caramel and perhaps chocolate.",,,others,medium,Flying Goat Coffee,
New Guinea Certified Organic,not disclosed,"The earthy flavor dominates the profile. Fortunately, the earth tones are pleasingly sweet and fresh, with just enough herby pungency to complicate rather than distract. The sweetness intensifies toward the finish. The hardness that sometimes sits on the profiles of back-yard-processed coffees like these is barely detectable here.",,,others,medium,Montana Coffee Traders,
Costa Rica Lomas al Rio,not disclosed,"Ingratiating and open, this coffee makes the most of what it brings to the cup. Not bright but gently lively, nicely balanced between sweet and dry tones, with a pleasant supporting resonance. As the cup cools a slight, almost indistinguishable (storage-related?) hardness seems to shadow the sweetness.",,,others,medium,Alterra Coffee Roasters,
Organic Blue de Brazil Estate,not disclosed,"Judged on aroma alone, this coffee easily would top the ratings. Intense, deeply dimensioned nut tones soar with an exhilarating sweetness.

Organic Sumatran Reserve,not disclosed,"The center of the profile is satisfyingly round and full but rather opaque, without lift or brightness.

The impassive profile reveals nuance only as it fades rather richly in the aftertaste.",,,others,medium,Green Mountain Coffee Roasters,
Costa Rican Poás Volcano,not disclosed,"The coffee is buried under the taste of the roast. To the roastmaster's credit, however, this is no thin, carbony super-dark roast.

The sweetness intensifies somewhat in the finish, pushing the pungency toward chocolate. It never quite gets there, however.",,,others,dark,Muddy Waters Coffee,
Mexico Organic,Mexico,Extraordinary aroma,,,others,medium,Batdorf & Bronson,
Costa Rica,not disclosed,"Floral, fruity tones dominate, modulating to a sweet spiciness in the finish. The fruit reasserts itself in the long aftertaste.

Costa Rican Viennese,not disclosed,"A natural, vanilla-toned sweetness distinguishes a low-key but lively profile. Nut and spice notes complicate the vanilla sweetness in the aroma, but by finish and aftertaste the vanilla gently (and pleasingly) dominates. Little range or dimension; the vanilla is the main act.",,,others,medium,Orleans Coffee Exchange,
Vienna Roast,not disclosed,"Some cups of the sample are marred by a slight but distracting hardness, probably a fault in either drying or storage of the green coffee.

Elm City House Blend,not disclosed,"About half the cups of this low-toned but forceful blend hint at the taste defect called bagginess, a flat, ropey taste green coffee acquires when it has not been fully cured before shipping or stored properly.

Guatemala La Flor del Cafe,not disclosed,"The acidity is light and bright with a shimmer of fruit. At the center of the profile a slight pungency is nuanced by dry wine tones. Not much range, but solid dimension and outstanding balance.",,,others,medium,City Bean Coffee,
Kenya AA,not disclosed,"The winy acidity characteristic of Kenyas here is pungent and deep, without a trace of fruit or shimmer of berry. It is possible the coffee has faded a bit in storage. Still, a powerful coffee that offers an interesting twist to the Kenya theme.",,,others,medium,Torreo Coffee and Tea,
Blue Ribbon Blend,not disclosed,"It is interesting. The solid, rather simple profile is centered on a deep, mouth-filling, pungent richness. Buried in the pungency is an odd but not unpleasant note that I don't quite remember tasting in coffee",,,others,medium,Orleans Coffee Exchange,
Kenya Nyaithee AA,not disclosed,"It is a measure of this coffee's complexity that every time I returned to the cup it provoked new adjectives. Winy (the favorite), pungent and smoky, vanilla overtones, and in the finish sweetness, prune and chocolate. The body is rather full for a Kenya, and the cup almost shockingly rich. Like all great Kenyas this one keeps shifting and building complexity from first impression through aftertaste.",,,others,medium,Alpen Sierra Coffee Roasters,

Bayview Farms Kona Extra Fancy,not disclosed,"Complete and classic. Dry and acidy, but the acidity is held inside a deep, resonant matrix and complicated by richly wine-tinged fruit tones. Sweetens exquisitely in the finish. The medium body is smooth and buttery.",,,others,medium,Armeno Coffee,
Mocha Java Blend,not disclosed,"An extraordinarily clean, elegant Mocha-Java. The contribution of the two Ethiopian coffees is brightly fruity, floral and exhilaratingly fresh. The Java mostly stays out of the way, contributing a slight pungency to balance the Ethiopias' high-toned sweetness. The light body could be taken as a fault, but I found it more exhilaratingly weightless than disappointingly thin.",,,others,medium,Jeremiah's Pick Coffee,
Yemen Mocha Mattari,not disclosed,"Distinct fruity chocolate tones, cherryish and round, are balanced by a tobaccoey dryness. When the coffee is hot the chocolate-fruit tones are fresh, complex, and thrilling.

Guatemala Coban,Guatemala,"The superb oxymoron of this coffee, powerfully sweet yet sharply pungent, is at its best in aroma and in finish, when the pungent tones soften to a distinct and pleasing spice. Rich, clean aftertaste; medium to light body.",,,others,medium,Oren's Daily Roast,
Nantucket Blend,not disclosed,"This delightfully gentle coffee is soft, brightly (and lightly) acidy, slightly floral. The aftertaste is as clean as white clapboard, with a lovely vanilla/floral burst, then a memory of pure sweetness. Not much power or depth here, but with a coffee this chastely bright and sweet who cares.",,,others,medium,Green Mountain Coffee,
Costa Rica Doka Estate,not disclosed,"A fresh, clean, delightfully natural sweetness is balanced by a drier but still fruity pungency. A fine and distinctive coffee, though memorable more for what it gives out front than what it insinuates. The profile is immediate and pleasing rather than deep.",,,others,medium,Willoughby's Coffee & Tea,
French Roast,not disclosed,"A fine example of the French-roast archetype. The carbon notes, as integral to French roasts as smoky notes are to Scotch whiskey, are discreet. The main taste complex here is sweet vanilla, floating above a dry, light pungency. Carbon notes prevail in the aftertaste, though a persistent low-toned sweetness gives them a run.",,,others,medium,Thanksgiving Coffee,

Portside Blend,not disclosed,"Aromatic and gently complex. Delicate, sweet-vanilla nose.

Skye’s Mountain Blend Decaf,Blend,"Not nearly as dramatic as the Olympic mountains, but satisfying and substantial.

Monsooned Malabar,not disclosed,"Pungent chocolate in the nose. Slightly sharp in the cup, with distinct tobacco notes and a hint of dry chocolate. Solid body but little resonance.",,,others,medium,Armeno Coffee,
Guatemala – Finca Dos Marias,not disclosed,"A quietly dramatic coffee with a long development, in which a clear if understated acidity gives way to a sudden sweet lift in the cup, and nutty, pungent (perhaps smoky) notes are balanced by vanilla sweetness. All of the complex gestures remain in balance, and a silky smoothness envelops even the potentially sharp pungency.",,,others,medium,Green Mountain Coffee,
AA – Green,not disclosed,"A straightforward coffee, nicely balanced, clean and free of taint except (perhaps) a slight grassiness, a shadow note possibly encouraged by the rather light roast. Panelists noted nutty tones in the aroma and a hint of chocolate in the finish (""cocoa-like"" specified one). Why wasn't this fundamentally centered, pleasant coffee not rated higher? Only one panelist registered enthusiasm. I suspect a lack of what some call power and I call dimension -- the sense of unnamed, resonant sensation opening behind the initial impression.",,,others,medium,Yauco Selecto,
Jamaica Blue Mountain #1’s – Green,not disclosed,"Reactions to this coffee ranged from enthusiasm to mild approval to ambivalence. The enthusiasts and mild approvers both tended to cite gently bright acidity, full body, and nut-toned aromatics. The enthusiasts felt the coffee brought power to the cup (""packs a punch""), while the approvers felt it didn't (""mild, mild, mild; sweet and soft cup""). The ambivalencers also honored the virtues of the coffee, but detected a slight shadow taint. One suggested that the sample was a bit ""faded,"" another ""baggy."" Both adjectives suggest this otherwise meticulously clean coffee suffered very mild damage, perhaps moisture-related, during transport or storage.",,,others,medium,Old Tavern Estate,
Jamaica Blue Mountain – Green,not disclosed,"The most thoughtful assessments of this coffee characterized it as a potentially powerful but flawed coffee. ""Although a little bit grassy, maybe due to lack of 'reposo' [resting the coffee after processing], this is a very good coffee,"" concluded one panelist. ""Interesting undomesticated flavors,"" offered another. ""One of those coffees that makes me scratch my head and say 'You're different, but do I really want to know you better?'"" On the upside panelists cited this coffee's sweet fruit and richness. On the downside it elicited terms like weedy, oniony, or soapy. The most comprehensive attempt at describing the off-taste cited ""Aromas of dried onions, grains and soy-sauce.""",,,others,medium,Mavis Bank,
Jamaica High Mountain – Green,not disclosed,"Another coffee whose assessment was dominated by roast issues. In this case, seven of eight panelists objected that the sample was roasted a bit too light. However, this complaint was offered as an aside to generally approving appraisals of the coffee itself. A general picture emerges of a well-prepared, clean coffee, sweet and balanced, with hints of fruit and nut. ""Aroma of Spanish peanuts carries through to the flavor,"" concluded one panelist. ""Pleasantly focused cup."" Given the tone of approval in written comments, I can only assume that this coffee was not rated higher because it lacked power and dimension.",,,others,medium,Baronhall Estate,
Haiti – Green,not disclosed,"Although this is not quite the deep, almost syrupy sweet Haitian coffee I recall occasionally tasting before Haiti's latest run of political misfortunes, it is a good coffee, and a very promising one, given the relative newness of the admirable Cafeieres Natives project. On the upside, sweet, ingratiating aromatics. Three panelists called these high, delicate notes floral; three others mentioned cocoa or chocolate; one mint. The more tactile aspects of the cup disturbed some, however. Two used the word ""gritty""; one ""muddy."" I found the cup (with patience) rich, but opaque and without dimension or resonance.",,,others,medium,Haitian Bleu,
Dominican Republic – Green,not disclosed,"I found this coffee quite impressive when hot, with the sort of resonant dimension and long, gradually sweetening development I admire. However, for me the profile turned a bit grassy and hard as it cooled. The rest of the panel didn't have much to say about this coffee one way or the other. A few complaints surfaced suggesting roughness or hardness; one panelist reported ""good intensity/balance, [though] not enough intensity for my taste."" It would appear that a lack of character rather than taint or weakness doomed this coffee to a relatively low rating.",,,others,medium,Montanas Cresta,
Dominican Republic – Green,not disclosed,"Something was slightly off with this coffee. Two panelists mentioned ferment but I doubt it. One called the taint grassy; ""slightly harsh & earthy"" wrote another; I had it as ""a touch of hard tobacco, herb."" Whatever it was, it brought down the rating of this otherwise ingratiatingly sweet, rounded coffee with subtle grace notes variously described as chocolate, vanilla, and (the favorite) caramel.",,,others,medium,Casa Toral,
Dominican Republic – Green,not disclosed,"The majority of panelists dismissed this coffee as fermented, the flavor defect that results from the some of the beans picking up the rotten-fruit taste of fermenting sugars during processing or drying. ""Trying to be constructive here but can't find any grounds for redemption,"" wrote one. However, three panelists were open to redemption, rating this coffee in the low 80s, perhaps reading the ferment tones as fruity or wine-like. Two of the three yea-sayers struggled with their ambivalence in their comments, finally coming down on the positive side of the fruit/ferment continuum. The matrix of sensation under and around the ferment definitely was full and complex.",,,others,medium,"Americo, Melo & Co.",
Green Coffee,not disclosed,"This coffee manifested some brightness and acidity in the cup, which probably accounted for a higher rating than one would expect given that several panelists complained of a background shadow or taint. I called the problem a ""slight, high, hard fruitiness."" Another cupper identified it as grassiness; another detected a ""rubbery"" taste; still another concluded the coffee was ""faded."" Not much consensus in those descriptions, but clearly something was off. Two of us noted that the profile tended to vary from cup to cup, with some cups bright with a floral or fruit-toned acidity, and some dulled by the elusive taint.",,,others,medium,Rey Mezzanotte,
Bella Vista Tres Rios,not disclosed,Liveliest and most resonant of the dark-roast samples in the cupping,,,others,dark,Starbucks Coffee,
Costa Rican,not disclosed,"Whether deriving from the unorthodox roasting style or the coffee itself, a spicy pungency weaves its way through this rather soft, medium-bodied profile. At moments this flavor complex suggests chocolate, at others the earthy tones associated with some Indonesian coffees, at others a dark fruitiness-just-short-of-ferment. In the context of the overall sweet, intriguing, broad range of this coffee I tolerated this taste, even liked it, though purists may find it distracting.",,,others,medium,Steaming Bean Coffee,
Costa Rica Tres Rios,not disclosed,"Pleasant though restrained aroma; outstanding cup.

May not generate enough sweetness to round the acidity, however, leaving the cup just a touch on the sour side. Not much nuance but solid body.",,,others,medium,Dallis Bros. Coffee,
"Costa Rica, La Amistad",not disclosed,"Like so many coffees in the cupping, solid overall but short on sweetness and nuance. In this case, splendidly rich, broad-ranged aroma, decent acidity with a hint of fruit, but generally pungent and rather opaque, with only a touch of sweetness in the finish. A trace of the vanilla-toned richness that dominated in aroma re-emerges in the aftertaste.",,,others,medium,Gillies Coffee Co.,
Costa Rican Tarrazu,not disclosed,"A low-toned sweetness balances a discreet acidity. Full body, rich spiciness in the cup. The vanilla-nut tones in the aroma resurface fleetingly in the aftertaste. Unfortunately, an additional odd taste also surfaces, particularly when the coffee is cold. This taste, perhaps a mild processing taint, lowered my rating of this otherwise excellent sample.",,,others,medium,Café Society Coffee,
Costa Rican Tarrazu,not disclosed,"The exhilarating vanilla-nut tones in the aroma together with the heavy, buttery body are the main pleasures here.

Costa Rica,not disclosed,"The slightly carbony cup seems more heavy than rich until the finish, when a deep-toned, pruny sweetness prevails, enlivened by a touch of spice or sandalwood.

Costa Rica,not disclosed,"The aroma sweetens the dark-roast pungency with a singing hint of vanilla, but the pungent character bluntly prevails in the cup.

Costa Rica – La Minita Tarrazu,not disclosed,"Complex, enveloping, spacious, echoing with subtle, unnameable tones and innuendoes. The acidity is solidly wrapped in sweetness and body. Surprising chocolate tones emerge as the cup cools. The aftertaste is lasting and seductively complex.",,,others,medium,Alpen Sierra Coffee Roasters,
Caffe del Sol,not disclosed,"In the demitasse this blend is complexly crisp and pungent; richly dry chocolate notes are supported by an understated sweetness. Perhaps the heavy, smoothly balanced body accounts for the splendid impact this coffee makes in milk. The dairy relaxes the crisp chocolate notes and the coffee richly suffuses the milk rather than penetrating it.",,,others,medium,Caffe Vita Coffee Roasting Co.,
Espresso á Sante,not disclosed,"This smooth, understated blend displays an impressive variety of nuance throughout its development, from elusive vanilla-nut tones in the mild aroma through smoky and spicy notes in the cup to a touch of fruit or chocolate in aftertaste. In milk the profile is clean, sweet and balanced.",,,others,medium,K & F Select,
Fazenda Vista Alegre,not disclosed,"For an espresso this coffee is relatively light-roasted, allowing cup characteristics of the green coffee to emerge in the demitasse. The vanilla-nut tones characteristic of many Brazil dry-processed coffees weave pleasantly through the profile, appearing with particular clarity in aroma and aftertaste. Unfortunately, the herby, earthy sharpness of some dry-processed Brazils also surfaces, especially in the aftertaste. All earthy peccadilloes disappear in milk, however. The sharp, earthy tones mute, the nut tones bloom, and the entire profile relaxes and turns sweet yet forceful.",,,others,medium,City Bean Coffee,
Malabar Gold,not disclosed,"The elegant, sweetly complex nose of this coffee translates disappointingly to the cup, where sharp, rough tones distract from the lingering traces of spice and fruit. The aftertaste is long but rather astringent. Handles milk with authority but without much resonance or complexity. The robustas in the blend contribute a very dense, fine-textured crema in the straight shot.",,,others,medium,Josuma Coffee Company,
Italian Roast Espresso,not disclosed,"The dry, dark-roast pungency avoids burned or excessively bitter tones. The pleasantly smoky bite displays a touch of sweetness in the finish and the aftertaste is comfortably free of astringency. In milk rich and balanced.",,,others,medium,Caffé Trieste,
Espresso Blend,not disclosed,"A clean, simple pop across the palate. No carbon, not sharp, but not much sweetness or nuance either. Nut tones surface in the finish. My tasting partner was more specific",,,others,medium,City Bean Coffee,
Espresso Roast,not disclosed,"For me this rather dark-roasted blend's smoky pungency displayed pleasantly fruity tones in the demitasse, and remained (if precariously) on the soft side of bitter. I particularly liked this blend in milk",,,others,medium,La Costa Coffee Roasting,
Novacella Decaf,not disclosed,"Only a touch of sweetness survives to balance the sharp tones of a very dark roast, but the sharpness is complicated (perhaps rounded) by chocolaty, pruny tones. The aroma is crisp, alive, even elegant, but the profile tends to simplify in the cup and trail off into dimensionless astringency in the aftertaste. At best medium body. Turns sweet and smooth in milk but remains underpowered.",,,others,medium,Caffe Vita Coffee Roasting Co.,
Perugia Blend,not disclosed,"Levitating with sweetness, clean, complete, balanced, powerful yet elegant, this blend displays tremendous development and dimension. By development I mean the profile transforms in subtle modulations from aroma through aftertaste -- in this case from chocolate and toast notes in aroma and cup to sweet spice tones in finish. Dimension means sensations resonate and expand in nose and on palate rather than standing pat at first impression. In milk this blend remains pleasantly nutty-sweet and complete, but surrenders the complexity and intensity it displayed in the demitasse.",,,others,medium,Torrefazione Italia,
Espresso Blend,not disclosed,Virtually all sweetness has been driven out of the coffee by the roast,,,others,medium,Calistoga Roastery,
Kona – Green,not disclosed,"The first of four Konas with identical scores of 79 and very similar flavor profiles. Overall assessments of this sample ranged from bland on the downside to balanced on the upside. Which side of the bland/balanced divide panelists settled on probably depended on their predispositions in regard to the Kona profile generally. Three panelists, including me, detected subtle but pleasant wine tones. Three called the acidity sweet, which I assume was praise as well as description. No taints or defects cited; consensus on body",,,others,medium,Wailapa Farms,
Natural Moka – Green,not disclosed,"To say this coffee has an atypical profile for a Hawaii coffee is an understatement. Comparing it to the other coffees in the cupping is worse than comparing apples and oranges - more like comparing apples and cocker spaniels. The Kaanapali dry-process Moka is, as one panelist called it, a ""Yemen wannabe."" The trees that produced it are Yemen varietals, and the coffee has been processed in the simple, put-it-out-in-the-sun-to-dry approach used in Yemen and parts of Ethiopia. Which means that, like a Yemen or dry-processed Ethiopia, it is fruity, winy, complex, with a disturbingly lush, overripe aftertaste that lovers of these coffees call gamy or wild and people who don't like Yemen or dry-processed Ethiopia coffees call fermented.Five panelists labeled this coffee fermented and dismissed it with very low scores; three recognized the Yemen/Ethiopia characteristics and treated it like a middle-of-the-road dry-processed Yemen/Ethiopia coffee, giving it scores in the high seventies. Four didn't call it anything but gave it low scores.If this coffee had been presented to the panel in the context of similar dry-processed coffees from Yemen or Ethiopia I don't think it would have provoked quite the same level of criticism. For this reason we're not publishing its scores. However, it did not fare well in the context of this particular cupping.",,,others,medium,Kaanapali Estate Coffee,
Yellow Caturra – Green,not disclosed,"An interesting coffee that provoked a wide range of reaction. Everyone agreed that it was a soft coffee with medium body. The controversy centered on the flavor complex at the heart of the profile, which elicited characterizations ranging from ""delightfully spicy"" and ""richly chocolaty"" to ""harsh, burned and disturbing"" and ""burned seaweed, or something I had in a sushi bar(!)."" Scores also varied wildly. The nays didn't outnumber the yeas, but the naysayers nayed with more conviction than the yeasayers yeaed, culminating in a low average score. Readers who like low-acid profiles may want to try this coffee anyhow. At a moderately dark brown or full-city roast I suspect the controversial flavor complex will lose its slightly hard edge and turn definitively complex and rich.",,,others,medium,Kaanapali Estate Coffee,
Kona – Green,not disclosed,Majority opinion,,,others,medium,Hamasaki Estate,
Organic Kona – Green,not disclosed,"This medium-bodied, fruit-toned coffee attracted strong support from several panelists, who apparently admired its solid acidity, balanced, low-key intensity and fruity nuances. Two panelists detected a faint hardness or bagginess in the aftertaste, although both assigned the coffee respectable scores anyhow.",,,others,medium,Guyer Farms,
Kona – Green,not disclosed,"The clear winner in this cupping, as it was in the 1997 Kona Coffee Cultural Festival Cupping Competition. The reason",,,others,medium,Fitzgerald Estate,
Kona Extra Fancy – Green,not disclosed,"The Kona song is the same, but this coffee sang it a little stronger and cleaner. No taints or weaknesses whatsoever were cited for this sample. Characterizations of overall flavor, which with the somewhat lower-rated Konas tended to be evenly divided between naysaying ""bland"" and yeasaying ""balanced,"" here clearly settled on balanced. Occasional little pleasured exclamations turned up on the cupping forms",,,others,medium,Bayview Farms,
Green Coffee: Kona,not disclosed,"Several panelists described distinct wine tones, which seemed to be the main nuance that separated this Kona from the others clustered in the middle of the cupping. Otherwise, the familiar Kona profile emerges",,,others,medium,Honomalino Estate,
Sumatra Mandheling,not disclosed,"Not entirely typical for a Sumatra, but something of a revelation",,,others,medium,First Colony Coffee & Tea,
Sumatra Mandheling,not disclosed,"Another solid, heavy-centered Sumatra. Here, however, the dark center reveals hints of wine and a character more complexly pungent than sweet. The pungency is free of earthy or hard notes, and reads as the very quintessence of rich.",,,others,medium,Willoughby's Coffee & Tea,
Sumatra Lintong Zamrud,not disclosed,"An understated sweet liveliness lifts the rather stolid heart of this coffee. I can't cite any grace notes, simply a very pleasant, sweet lift. Good dimension, but (for a Sumatra) a rather shallow bottom.",,,others,dark,City Roast,
Sumatra Blue Lintong “Yiayia”,not disclosed,"Low-toned, full-bodied, absolutely solid at the center (maybe too), with slight hints of fruit and sweetness at the edges. In other words, a typical Sumatra. Would be a classic Sumatra if there were something more going on inside that center or a little more shimmer or lift around those edges. As it is, substantial, satisfying, but a touch inert.",,,others,medium,Berardi's Fresh Roast,
Dark Sumatra,not disclosed,"The dark roast style leans toward carbon here but remains on the flavorful side of it, turning the Sumatra richness pungent and darkening the sweet tones with hints of what a publicist might call chocolate. If this coffee had showed some development I would have rated it higher, but the profile made its statement and stood pat from there. As with the other Café d'Alma coffees in the cupping, I suspect a loss of aromatics in shipping.",,,others,dark,Café d'Alma,
Organic Sumatran Reserve,not disclosed,"Another typically full-bodied, solid-centered Sumatra. Not much range or complexity, but good development",,,others,medium,Green Mountain Coffee Roasters,
Sumatra,not disclosed,"Another Sumatra carried to a dark roast with enough tact to avoid carbon. But, alas, not enought to save the sweetness and nuance. What's left is a balanced dry heaviness that can be read as richness.",,,others,dark,Pegasus Coffee,
Organic Sumatra,not disclosed,"Herbal, pungent tones, a bit too sharp for earthy, dominate the profile, reverberating in its characteristically solid Sumatra heart. Only a touch of sweet nuance, but the herbal tones are intriguing. They turn slightly hard as the coffee cools.",,,others,dark,Taylor Maid Farms,
Sumatra,not disclosed,"A darkish roast style asserts itself here, turning the heavy Sumatra center distinctly pungent. A slight sweetness emerges in the finish, but the mildly astringent pungency dominates in the aftertaste. A vibrant aliveness in the center of this coffee is its most attractive feature.",,,others,dark,Peaberry's Coffee & Tea,
Sumatra Mandheling,not disclosed,An interesting but atypical Sumatra profile,,,others,medium,Coffee Masters,
Organic Sumatran,not disclosed,"Another heavy-centered Sumatra, this one with hints of sweetness and vanilla all but buried under an herby, earthy character. The earthiness is rough but rather pleasant, with only the barest hint of hardness.",,,others,medium,Café d'Alma,
Sumatra Mandheling,not disclosed,"Still another solid, deep Sumatra, but lacking range or dimension. Clean, one-dimensional, with little resonance in the heart of the coffee or shimmer around the edges. The aromatics seemed a bit tired; perhaps the problem here is a loss of aromatics in shipping.",,,others,medium,Café d'Alma,
Brazil Washed – Green,not disclosed,"We couldn't make up our collective mind about this wet-processed coffee. I found it light and pleasantly bright -- appropriate to a good wet-processed coffee from lower altitudes. Several agreed, finding the acidity fruity and sweet. Others, however, reacted critically to the delicate profile",,,others,medium,Monte Alegre,
Natural – Green,not disclosed,"Although this quietly elegant Brazil didn't attract the sort of raves the highest-rated Guatemala elicited in our July 1997 cupping, it did stimulate admiring comment and the highest rating in the cupping. ""Excellent overall. Stands by itself as an estate coffee."" ""This coffee is the best of the lot."" Admiration centered on a smoothly substantial body and a deeply nuanced flavor. Three reviewers identified the grace notes as chocolate, a term that came up only occasionally with other coffees. One even qualified chocolate by category",,,others,medium,Fazenda Turmalina,
Washed – Green,not disclosed,"""Yes! This is a coffee for non-believers. This sample will convert the pagans,"" wrote one reviewer, apparently a supporter of Brazil coffees. Well, most of the pagans stayed unconverted, still groveling about before their acidy Central-American idols. The usual vanilla and nut tones were noted approvingly in the aroma, the soft sweetness of the acidity observed, but little enthusiasm emerged in the categories of body, flavor or aftertaste. ""Not much depth,"" complained one. ""Very uniform throughout the range in all taste aspects,"" remarked another carefully, ""not lacking anything in particular, yet not exceeding in any category either."" Three reviewers noted mild faults, two with a forest products theme",,,others,medium,Fazenda Lagoa do Morro,
Natural – Green,not disclosed,"Although this dry-processed coffee scored roughly the same as the three preceding samples, reviewers' comments seemed to indicate a coffee with more character and development. No faults or weaknesses were noted, and a tone of quiet respect ran through the few comments on flavor and aftertaste",,,others,medium,Fazenda Lagoa,
Green,not disclosed,"""Clean, monolithic,"" one cupper wrote. ""OK but same old same,"" wrote another. One of four coffees in the cupping for which no faults whatsoever were cited; on the other hand, this carefully prepared coffee elicited only mild praise. The acidity was predictably characterized as ""soft"" (five of ten reviewers). Words like sweet and caramelly popped up occasionally. Only one reviewer actually effused",,,others,medium,Cachoeira Fernando Paiva,
Green Coffee,not disclosed,"Perhaps this coffee was betrayed by our sample roasting. Four of ten reviewers mentioned burned or smoky tastes that may have been owing to a rushed or overdeveloped roast. Two identified a fault that may be associated with the coffee and not the roast -- a slightly medicinal or harsh character. No grace notes were cited, although the term ""soft"" came up frequently as usual. I was definitely in the minority with this coffee",,,others,medium,Monte Alegre Natural,
Green Coffee,not disclosed,"It wasn't entirely clear whether it was a thin, attenuated quality that put this semi-dry-processed coffee near the bottom of the cupping (three reviewers explicitly used the word ""thin""), or an off-taste too subtle to be called a defect but unpleasant nonetheless. I called it a ""baggy hardness""; three other panelists also used the word ""hard"" to describe it; others used close synonyms like harsh and bitter. On the positive side, several praised this coffee's sweetness.",,,others,medium,Ipanema Gourmet,
Yuletide Mocha-Java Decaf,not disclosed,"Everything happens in the higher registers here, and a lot does. A wonderful, dry/sweet complex, almost effervescent, lifts the heart of this light, bright coffee. An amazing range of grace notes shimmer in the higher registers",,,others,medium,Armeno Coffee,
Mocca-Java,not disclosed,"One of the most successful Mocha-Javas in the cupping, this one opens with a shiver of rank Red Sea wildness, which almost immediately gives way to a swelling, lyrical fruitiness that persists sweetly and richly through the high-toned finish. A hint of the rankness resurfaces in the aftertaste. The pleasure here is almost entirely in the complex top of the profile; the bottom is a bit weak and underpowered.",,,others,medium,Gevalia,
Mocha Java Blend,not disclosed,"A rather rough ride. The first impression is complex, but not entirely pleasantly so",,,others,medium,Dallis Bros. Coffee,
Mocha-Java Style,not disclosed,"Clean and decisive profile, but a bit too much wallop and not quite enough tickle. Little sweetness or nuance. Some dimension, but a rather hard, winy (not fruity) acidity dominates, sitting on the rest of the profile.",,,others,medium,Backroads Coffee & Tea,
Mocha-Java Private Reserve,not disclosed,"The strength of this excellent Mocha-Java is in the full, rich body and complex bottom. The low notes remain alive, complicating and deepening through the finish. Not much lift or sweetness at the top, however. The only grace notes I detected were a touch of carbon and some heavy pruniness.",,,others,medium,J. Martinez & Co.,
Arabian Mocha Java,not disclosed,"A rather complex dark-roast cup. Clear carbon, but the roast was conducted with enough deliberation to preserve some richness and a touch of sweetness. The most engaging complication was in the dry center of the profile",,,others,dark,Starbucks Coffee,
"Mocha Java, Harrar Style",not disclosed,A clean but slightly oppressive hardness or astringency dampens the fruity Mocha-Java richness. A touch of carbon. The background fruitiness pleasantly hints at chocolate in the finish.,,,others,medium,Susan's Coffee and Tea,
Mocha-Java Blend,not disclosed,"Not much in the way of grace notes or fruit, but a very full body and an impressive range and dimension. The finish is rich and deep-toned. Only a trace of Red-Sea wildness from the Yemen.",,,others,medium,Armeno Coffee,
Mocha-Java Style,Blend,"Once again, a rather flat astringency, a sort of strident monotone, dominates the center of the profile, abetted in this case by a touch of carbony sharpness. Some fruit and sweetness, though the grace notes tend toward the tobacco and herb.",,,others,medium,Oren's Daily Roast,
Royal Mocha-Java,not disclosed,"This coffee was roasted so darkly and probably at such high temperatures that little was left to taste except overwhelming carbon plus a hint of high, singing sweetness that emerged in aroma and finish. The green coffee the roastmaster started with may well have been excellent, but the roast certainly wasn't.",,,others,dark,Royal Coffee,
Royal Vinter Kaffe,not disclosed,"An exceptionally luxuriant cup, from the deep, vibrant bottom to the lush but muted acidity. I particularly admire this coffee's dimension, the way it continues to develop in waves of gentle revelation from aroma through finish. The problem",,,others,medium,Gevalia,
Gourmet’s Choice,not disclosed,"Solid from top to bottom. The power in the lower ranges is particularly impressive for a coffee brought to a medium roast. Don't look for tickle, inspiration or sweetness, however. The grace notes, if any, tend toward herb or tobacco.",,,others,medium,Gourmet's Choice Coffee,
Reindeer Blend,not disclosed,"Rich, round, complete. The aroma in particular displayed an impressive range, from sweet nut tones through a dark pungency. This pleasing bittersweet balance prevailed through to finish. A good example of a coffee brought to a darkish roast style tactfully enough to avoid carbon while maintaining sweetness. Little discernible acidity, but enough to keep the profile from going flat.",,,others,medium,Caribou Coffee,
"Kenya AA, Grand Cru 1997",not disclosed,"The exhilaratingly bright, complexly winy acidity turns slightly hard and herbal as it settles on the palate, limiting the vivacity of the first impression. As the coffee cools the profile relaxes, allowing some rich sweetness to emerge behind the acidity.",,,others,medium,Allegro Coffee Roasters,
Celebration Caffe,not disclosed,"No carbon and lots of sweetness here, smoothing and rounding the dark-roast pungency. A pleasing smokiness turns sweet and ambiguously chocolate in the aftertaste.",,,others,medium,Allegro Coffee Roasters,
Holiday Blend,not disclosed,"A solid, balanced dark-roast profile. A hint of wine-toned acidity, perhaps even some wildness, teases from inside the fundamental dark-roast bittersweetness. Some carbon, but overall good range and structure.",,,others,medium,Jeremiah's Pick Coffee,
Holiday Blend,not disclosed,Hints of carbon mar an otherwise expansive profile,,,others,medium,Heritage Coffee Company,
Marrakesh Blend,not disclosed,"A dark-roast on the dry side. Preserves some of the bright, acidy tones of lighter roasts, balancing them with prune and tobacco in the mid ranges. No carbon, but not much sweetness either. Good range from top to middle of the profile, but short on depth and dimension.",,,others,dark,Caffeination,
Christmas Blend,not disclosed,"The elements of the dark-roast complex -- sweetness, pungency and carbon -- all work together smoothly here until the aftertaste, when carbon tones linger past any memory of sweetness. Until that moment, this coffee achieves an unassuming dark-roast completeness.",,,others,dark,Starbucks Coffee,
Mexico Maragogipe,not disclosed,"Bean-size aside, everything in this coffee walks the middle, from the subdued vanilla-nut complex in the aroma, through the clear but unemphatic acidity in the cup, to the clean aftertaste. Unfortunately, no resonance at the bottom of the profile, no shimmers at the top, no development in the finish. Satisfying but limited.",,,others,medium,Gevalia,
Hawaiian Christmas Roast,not disclosed,"Dominated by a pruny, rather heavy pungency at the heart of the profile, livened by only a faint shimmer of acidity. Not quite enough sweetness to balance the pungency or acidity to brighten it. The grace notes tend toward the dry and herbal.",,,others,medium,Lion Coffee,
Patshatl Blend,not disclosed,"Solid, full-bodied dark-roast cup. Carbon tones dominate the sweet side of the dark-roast equation, and only the hints of prune and chocolate relieve the ultimately rather austere profile.",,,others,dark,Heritage Coffee Company,
Shaded Decaf Mexican,not disclosed,"A tribute to dimension and balance. A complete, classic coffee; medium-bodied, with a discreetly wine-toned acidity and just a touch of darker-roasted pungency. Even displays a hint of carbon in the finish, which I could do without, but which some may take as a sign of completeness.",,,others,medium,Counter Culture Coffee,
"Song Bird, Costa Rican",not disclosed,"A superbly balanced coffee, with a low-toned, slightly winy acidity, a touch of vanilla in the nose, and a solid, dark-roast bottom with little in the way of carbony distraction.",,,others,medium,Thanksgiving Coffee,
Colombia Huila Supremo,not disclosed,"This one keeps coming; vistas of completeness unfold in small, repeated waves of exhilarating revelation. The profile is built around a deep-toned version of the classic vanilla-nut-toned flavor complex. Sufficient acidity; not strikingly sweet but sweet enough.",,,others,medium,Counter Culture Coffee,
Costa Rican Miravalles,not disclosed,"This coffee could be condemned for its lack of power or admired for its soft refinement and vanilla- and nut-toned sweetness. I bought in on the sweetness side. The vanilla-nut tones displayed remarkable persistence, complicating the aroma and lingering in the aftertaste with surprisingly clarity and richness.",,,others,medium,Coffee Bean International,
Organic Papua New Guinea,not disclosed,"High, wild, winy notes rip through this coffee, first thrilling us, then turning uncomfortably lush in the finish, finally leveling out in a relatively clean aftertaste. American coffee culture hasn't made up its mind about this overripe, edge-of-compost taste. Is it a strange and wonderful gift of nature to be treasured, like the carefully cultivated mold in certain cheeses? Or do we dismiss it as a symptom of poorly-handled coffee?",,,others,medium,Allegro Coffee Roasters,
Organic Guatemalan,not disclosed,"Some attractive grace notes teased their way through the balanced, unassuming profile. I read them as herbal in my notes on aroma and chocolate when I got to the cup. Either way they're on the low-toned, pungent side of the taste ledger rather than the high and sweet.",,,others,medium,Frontier Coffee,
Nicaraguan Maragogipe,Nicaragua,A complete but rather simple profile; decent acidity balances the pungency of the moderately dark roast. Hints of vanilla intensify and the entire profile sweetens as the coffee cools.,,,others,medium,Thanksgiving Coffee,
New Guinea Nectar,not disclosed,"My rating for this coffee rose steadily as it cooled. At first the profile seemed pleasant yet inert, without lift or innuendo. But as I came back to it the coffee seemed to elevate, lighten and sweeten, and in the end the combination of substantial body and unassuming sweetness won me over.",,,others,medium,Adam's Organic Coffees,
Guatemalan Santiago Atitlan,not disclosed,"The aroma was curiously flat, the body ordinary, but the acidity splendid",,,others,medium,Allegro Coffee Roasters,
Guatemala Atitlan,not disclosed,"A sweet nuttiness dominates here, startling in its clarity. This taste complex, typically a bit player in coffees, takes extravagant control of this one, upstaging everything else. True, a hint of wine made itself heard above the sweetness of the acidity. Perhaps some slightly hard, metallic or tobacco tones flitted across the stage just as the lights went down.",,,others,medium,Coffee Bean International,
Organic Peruvian Select,not disclosed,"I found this coffee's profile interesting but rather odd. It displayed a heavy, dull-yet-rich quality, reminiscent of some Indonesian and East-Indian coffees, plus a distinct earth taste. Literally earth; this coffee is neither dirty in the general sense nor earthy in the romantic sense; rather, the cup simply tastes a bit like dirt. There are other intrigues as well",,,others,medium,Green Mountain Coffee Roasters,
Mexican Stewardship Coffee,not disclosed,A substantial coffee without much in the way of surprise or intrigue. Odd smoky or pruny tones surfaced in the aroma and finish. Displayed enough acidity to avoid flatness but not enough to excite. The absence of sweetness and nuance in the upper ranges more than anything else relegated this coffee to the agreeably ordinary.,,,others,medium,Green Mountain Coffee Roasters,
Sumatra Mandheling,not disclosed,"""Distinct fruity, pruny carbon tones; not much else,"" I wrote the first time I cupped this coffee. I used almost the same words the second time around. Simply not enough going on here. The carbon is not the thin, burned-out sensation of overdone French roasts, by the way. More the taste of very dark toast with a memory of marmalade.",,,others,medium,The Organic Coffee Co.,
Nicaraguan Segovia,not disclosed,"The high point was the dazzling aroma, full of heady vanilla tones shimmering over a rich pungency. Subsequently, things went downhill. A hardness emerged in the aftertaste, and as the coffee cooled the entire profile stiffened and lost its sweetness. Perhaps the coffee was not sturdy enough to sustain its aromatics in the moderately dark roast style.",,,others,medium,Organic Coffee Company,
Qualita Oro,not disclosed,"Italians, it is said, don't care for the acidity, the bright, dry sensation valued in American drip coffees. Ironically, this blended-in-Italy coffee displays more acidy notes than any other in the tasting. The dry, fruity notes enliven and lift the typically rounded Espresso profile. The roast adds smoky, spicy notes that dance on the edge of carbon without committing.",,,others,medium,Lavazza,
Dancing Goats Blend,Blend,"Simple but centered, a classically solid Espresso. Once past the low-key, caramel/toast/chocolate nose I didn't register much in the way of grace notes, but neither was I oppressed by carbon. My taster colleague picked up muted wine-fruit tones. In milk, sweet and substantial.",,,others,medium,Batdorf & Bronson,
New Moon Espresso,not disclosed,"I found this blend low-toned and pungently fruity, although the fruitiness was dry rather than sweet. For me the pungency turned pleasantly round, sweet, and chocolaty when combined with milk. My tasting colleague didn't respond to the pungency in any context. She found this blend too sharp in a demitasse and too thin in milk.",,,others,medium,Thanksgiving Coffee,
Espresso Dolce,not disclosed,"Another dark-roast blend in which the sweet-chocolate-vanilla complex barely makes it out from under the carbon. But it does, and a muted vanilla sweetness lifts the profile in the finish. Milk, as usual, smooths the carbon and glorifies the sweetness.",,,others,dark,PJ's Coffee & Tea,
Major Dickason’s Blend,not disclosed,"Not much fruit here and lots of rather twisty, smoky carbon. But if you're patient the sweet-pungent Espresso complex emerges behind the carbon, with perhaps a hint of chocolate. The carbon flattens the profile in the finish, but the body is husky and the entire package improves in milk, which as usual ramps up the sweetness and exaggerates the chocolate.",,,others,dark,Peet's Coffee & Tea,
"Espresso Blend, So. Italian",not disclosed,"The aromatics of the vanilla-chocolate complex fade fast under the impact of the carbon, although the clean-sweat pungency will please lovers of extremely dark roasts. The blanketing astringency of the carbon reaches a climax in the aftertaste, but even there sweetness balances and pungency complicates.",,,others,dark,Thanksgiving Coffee,
Espresso Blend,not disclosed,"A carbony bite suggests this blend may have been roasted too quickly. Otherwise a very agreeable, rather straightforward Espresso, with solid body and a satisfying balance of sweet and pungent tones. The profile fades rather quickly in the finish, perhaps owing to a rushed roast that burned off aromatics.",,,others,dark,Bucks County Coffee,
Illy Espresso,not disclosed,"The elegant fruit and toast tones in the aroma fade quickly, leaving a surprisingly hard, astringent profile behind, free of carbon but equally empty of acidy or grace notes, displaying more tactile than aromatic power. The profile sweetens and rounds in milk.",,,others,medium,Illy Espresso,
Vesuvio Blend,Blend,"This remarkably light, self-effacing blend displays no acidity and no bitterness. Only the slightest carbon astringency surfaces in the aftertaste. Unfortunately, this tribute to subtlety doesn't display much power or complexity either -- only an evanescent caramel-chocolate sweetness, which loses its way almost completely in milk.",,,others,medium,Batdorf & Bronson,
Napoli Blend,Various,"The clear winner in the tasting, perhaps because it showed pungent dark-roast character without losing sweetness or complexity to carbon. Distinct chocolate notes, good dimension, substantial body, smooth balance of bitter and sweet tones, although the bitterness does get the upper hand in the aftertaste. Fills out nicely in milk without losing authority or complexity.",,,others,dark,Torrefazione Italia,
Perugia Blend,not disclosed,A distinct bouquet of floral and fruit notes enlivens and complicates the chocolate-vanilla Espresso sweetness while freshening and brightening the aftertaste. Altogether a rather remarkable Espresso,,,others,medium,Torrefazione Italia,
El Salvador – Green,not disclosed,"Sweet-nuanced words like nutty, fruity and caramelly dominated reports on this coffee. ""Interesting combination of aspects,"" said one. I found the acidity a bit hard behind the fruit tones, but almost no one else complained. One cupper alone found a defect",,,others,medium,Santa Adelaide Cooperative,
El Salvador – Green,not disclosed,Most of the wallflower coffees near the bottom of the rankings managed to seduce at least one or two of the Cupping Board with their soft sweetness. I fell for this one. I found it light but pleasingly subtle and complex in the upper registers. I wasn't completely alone,,,others,medium,San Isidro Cooperative,
El Salvador – Green,not disclosed,A familiar story,,,others,medium,San Agustin,
El Salvador – Green,not disclosed,"Almost everyone remarked on the paradox of an acidity that read as complex and fruit-toned, yet oddly hard. ""Very good taste but not refined, bright and brassy""; ""winy but flat""; ""sharp yet sweet""; and most succinct",,,others,medium,Pacas Martinez Tonita,
El Salvador – Green,not disclosed,"Although the overall rating earned by this coffee was the same as the rating for the preceding Larin pacamara, the comments were less effusive. No exclamation points, and the poker-faced praise-word ""nice"" came up twice",,,others,medium,Los Ausoles Cooperative,
El Salvador – Green,not disclosed,Two contributors admired this coffee for its soft sweetness. Everyone else found it commonplace,,,others,medium,Las Lajas Cooperative,
Pacamara El 98 – Green,not disclosed,"One of the two clear winners in the cupping, this coffee's delicate, sweet top notes and complex aromatics attracted a bouquet of admiring adjectives, including caramelly (the favorite), floral and fruity.

First",,,others,medium,Larin,
Bourbon – Green,not disclosed,Blind assessment,,,others,medium,Larin,
El Salvador – Green,not disclosed,"Few complaints here, but not much enthusiasm either. At least no one called this coffee ordinary or boring. ""Excellent coffee,"" said one, ""although repeated cuppings left me with a feeling of 'something lacking.'"" ""Doesn't go anywhere,"" I observed. However, one of the cuppers felt this coffee came ""back with a second level of depth; a good, full cup."" Perhaps the rest of us weren't patient enough.",,,others,medium,El Borbollon,
El Salvador – Green,not disclosed,"A decent coffee ruined by a probably avoidable defect. Parts of the bag from which our samples came apparently picked up moisture during storage. Some individual samples (perhaps from the top part of the bag) cupped cleanly and sweetly, but most displayed either a rope-like taste called baggy (cited by five cuppers) or the moldy-basement taste called musty (two cuppers), both defects typically caused by post-processing moisture. Inspection of this coffee revealed more visual defects than displayed by any of the Itzalco coffees in the cupping, which may indicate something additional went wrong before the coffee went into the bag.",,,others,medium,Don Hilario,

Decaffeinated Kenya AA,not disclosed,"A rather distinctive coffee marked by a clear, winy acidity that some would call bright and others sharp. I lean toward bright with rough edges. The acidity is so dominating that I had a difficult time reading the body",,,others,dark,The Roasterie,
Decaf Colombian Supremo,not disclosed,"Solid, balanced, with a slightly winy acidity wrapped in a substantial body, all characteristics of a good Colombia. But again, these virtues seem attenuated. The complexity is confined to the middle registers, with both top and bottom notes pinched off. A slight sweetness fills out the profile in the finish.",,,others,medium,Millstone Coffee,
Decaffeinated Kenya,not disclosed,"The acidity is powerful yet subdued, slightly (and properly, given the origin) winy. Not much depth or resonance, but a nutty sweetness emerges in the finish that surprises, given the origin. The roast contributes some slight carbon tones.",,,others,dark,Starbucks Coffee,
Decaffeinated French Roast,not disclosed,"One of the few coffees in the cupping with resonance and depth. You have to be patient with this coffee and wait for the heavy, pruny, dark-roast pungency to reveal itself in the finish, but it's worth the wait. If this coffee showed some acidity and top notes it might be a real winner. As it is, the attic is bare and all the fun is in the cellar, but that's probably as it should be in something called a French roast.",,,others,dark,Ancora Coffee Roasters,
Decaffeinated Natural Sidamo,not disclosed,"An unusual coffee, probably owing to the dry processing. The aroma is deep, rich, and powerful; the body full. In the cup, however, the power turns rather hard and herbal, almost peppery. Like so many coffees in the cupping, this one promises depth, yet won't let us past a hardness at the bottom of the profile.",,,others,dark,Ancora Coffee Roasters,
Decaffeinated Colombian,not disclosed,"Another coffee with a pleasing first impression. The acidity is deep, fruity, perhaps winy. But there's no cushion or bounce here, and little intrigue beyond the fruity acidity and a touch of carbon. The hard simplicity carries into the aftertaste, although the profile rounds a bit as the coffee cools.",,,others,medium,PJ's Coffee & Tea,
Decaffeinated Costa Rican,not disclosed,"The roast overwhelms the coffee here. The cup is carbon-toned and rather thin-bodied, with little nuance or dimension. Pleasant and without offense, but this Costa Rica's virtues and surprises apparently were left behind in the decaffeination vat and roasting smoke.",,,others,dark,PJ's Coffee & Tea,
Decaffeinated Sumatra Mandh.,not disclosed,"Little acidity and not much at the top, but balanced and complete in the middle ranges. Rich, particularly in the nose, although the rich impression doesn't develop beyond the first impression, and tends to fade in the finish.",,,others,medium,Ancora Coffee Roasters,
Decaffeinated Sumatra Mandh.,not disclosed,"A sweet-toned acidity, a sort of subdued brightness, enlivens this medium-bodied coffee. The sweetness reads with considerable complexity",,,others,medium,The Roasterie,
Decaffeinated Guatemala,Guatemala,"The acidity is pronounced, although more fruity and sweet than dry and brisk. Distinct chocolate tones nuance the fruit. The chocolate turns darkly prune-like in the finish, and lingers sweetly in the aftertaste. An attractive and ingratiating coffee, although the rather heavy body remains curiously inert under all the sweetness.",,,others,medium,Ancora Coffee Roasters,
Green,not disclosed,"This delicate coffee is the inverse of the San Rafael. Its virtues would seem to be softness, lightness, and buoyant top notes. Its weakness appears to be lack of power, and its faults failures of youth rather than age. Several cuppers detected floral tones. Others tasted notes ranging from spicy through herbal to nutty (the favorite, noted on three forms). Nevertheless, several cuppers were put off by shortcomings associated with immaturity",,,others,medium,Zacaleu,
Green,not disclosed,"Virtually everyone described this medium-bodied coffee as soft and sweet. About half of the cuppers reported nutty tones. Some stopped there. ""Unremarkable!"" exclaimed one. Several, however, also identified a light, high-toned acidity that balanced or complemented the sweetness. For example",,,others,medium,Santa Barbara,
Green,not disclosed,"Defects apparently consigned this rather heavy-bodied, low-toned Antigua to the bottom of the cupping-form pile. Some found its low-toned heaviness flat; others, however, liked it. Several called the profile ""sweet""; another ""solid."" One cupper raved",,,others,medium,San Rafael,
Green,not disclosed,"Most found this Antigua a bit underpowered, perhaps owing to its relatively light body (noted by almost everyone). Some found compensating virtues",,,others,medium,La Flor del Cafe,
Green,not disclosed,"For most the acidity was the main act here. Some found it pleasantly bright (""nice, winy and sharp,"" according to one); others complained it was too sharp, throwing off the balance of the coffee, and perhaps astringent in the aftertaste. Supporting virtue",,,others,medium,Dos Marias,
Green,not disclosed,"A provocative coffee. Everyone had something to say about it, yet no clear consensus emerged. The majority read the body as full (""even and full; well-balanced,"" according to one), but a small but outspoken minority found it light or even thin. Surprisingly, almost no one came down in the middle. Reactions to acidity were similarly mixed",,,others,medium,Cuchamatan,
Green,Guatemala,"Judging by the scores, I was in the minority here. I loved this Antigua for its dimension and completeness -- the way it resonated on the palate and developed, stretching into the distance behind the initial impression. Some cuppers agreed",,,others,medium,Bella Carmona,
Green,not disclosed,"A powerful but flawed coffee. Coffee professionals are familiar with the taste of ferment, caused when the sugars from the coffee fruit begin to go off while the fruit is still on the bean. The result is an odd, lush sensation that can register as ripe, overripe, or occasionally (particularly as the coffee cools) rotten. Cupper's comments reflect the ambivalence that mild ferment provokes. Almost everyone noted this coffee's luxuriant, wine-like fruitiness. Six cuppers detected a clear defect, however, and five of the six identified the defect (correctly in my view) as ferment, the shadow side of the fruitiness. Only one cupper dismissed the coffee on the basis of this defect, however, and in compensation several noted spicy nuances.",,,others,medium,Baja Vista,
Green,not disclosed,"Almost everyone remarked on a complex sweetness in this medium-bodied Huehuetenango. Some characterized the sweetness as chocolate-toned; others as caramel. Two assigned the sensations to that tantalizing cusp between chocolate and fruit. Most found the acidity sufficient to enliven the sweetness (""bright, pleasant, intriguing""), but one cupper complained that the acidity was disappointing and another that it was ""puckery."" There was an unusually wide range of response to body. Assessments ranged from light to (emphatically) heavy, with a consensus somewhere between medium and full. Perhaps our palates were confused by the pervasive sweetness, which can read as weight.",,,others,medium,Cerro Grande,
Traditional Premium Roast,not disclosed,"The aroma is complete but fades quickly. The acidity is bright, clear, and classic, hovering on the edge of winy. Some resonance echoes under the acidity, but both pleasure and complexity are concentrated at the top of the profile.",,,others,medium,Melitta,
Breakfast Blend,not disclosed,Herbal tones in the aroma turn spicy and fruity in the cup. The fruit nuances in the acidity lift the top of the profile and keep it light and shimmering all the way through to finish and aftertaste. Enough bottom for resonance.,,,others,medium,Millstone Coffee Company,
MJB Hawaiian Blend,not disclosed,"For a canned coffee, considerable aroma",,,others,medium,Nestle Beverage Company,
Folger Mountain Grown Coffee,not disclosed,"The aroma is slight but lively; the acidity is bright, classic and lightly assertive, remaining safely if precariously on the right side of sour. The bottom notes provide just enough ballast for the relatively buoyant acidity.",,,others,medium,Procter & Gamble,
Folgers French Roast,not disclosed,"A somewhat darker-than-supermarket-norm roast style helps mute acidity and sweeten the profile. Virtually no top notes, but a smooth, sweet-toned bottom with an attractive pruny finish.",,,others,medium,Procter & Gamble,
Moka Java,not disclosed,Superb aroma,,,others,medium,Trader Joe's,
100% Colombian,not disclosed,A deep bottom with just enough acidity to keep from the coffee from imploding into dullness. Other than the rather full body I read few signs of the Colombia profile in this decent but hardly exciting coffee.,,,others,medium,Yuban Coffee Company,
Hills Bros. Coffee,not disclosed,"A sweet nuttiness dominates here, without offense but also without much intrigue or energy. The nut-like tones may harbor a hint of acidity but no grace notes and little depth or dimension.",,,others,medium,Nestle Beverage Company,
Colombian Supremo,not disclosed,"For a moment, somewhere between nose and finish, this coffee struck me as rich with its nut and vanilla tones. But overall a thin-toned acidity dominates",,,others,medium,"Safeway, Inc.",
Lady Lee Coffee,not disclosed,"The vanilla / nut tones in the aroma fade quickly in the cup, giving way to a rather hard, characterless acidity that eventually takes on prune-like inflections in the finish.",,,others,light,Lucky Stores,
Maxwell House Master Blend,not disclosed,"Low-toned to the point of flatness. A hard, slightly metallic taste is the only sign of acidity. A sweet sensation that reads as vanilla in the nose and prune in the finish is the only saving virtue.",,,others,medium,Kraft Foods,
Original Bean Coffee,not disclosed,"Fermented notes, barely detectable in the acidy notes of the aroma, dominate in the cup, particularly as the coffee cools, turning from mild distraction to barnyard nasty.",,,others,medium,Eight O'Clock Coffee,
Ethiopia Yirgacheffe,not disclosed,"I wouldn't have expected a coffee so subtle to stand up to a dark roast so well. The roast only slightly mutes the heady floral tones of the aroma, while the acidity in tantalizing Yirgacheffe fashion hovers between flower and fruit. The body is hardly robust, but substantial enough to support the top notes. Only a trace of carbon.",,,others,dark,Orleans Coffee Exchange,
"Aged Sumatra Mandh., Pawani",not disclosed,"Spicy, perhaps smoky tones enliven the rich top notes of the aroma and carry into the cup. Surprisingly clear acidity, fine body, long finish, superb aftertaste.",,,others,dark,Armeno Coffee,
Guatemala Antigua,not disclosed,"This rich, deeply dimensioned, complex version of the great Guatemala profile happily combines clear, wine-toned acidity with satisfying dark-roast pungency. I even detected a hint of the famous Antigua smokiness smoldering somewhere inside the pungency.",,,others,dark,Starbucks Coffee,
Sumatra Mandheling,not disclosed,A model Mandheling,,,others,medium,Java City,
Gumanch,not disclosed,Some winy notes flirt from inside the dark-roast pungency. Otherwise an unremarkable but solid dark-roast coffee,,,others,dark,Uncommon Grounds,
Sulawesi,not disclosed,"Extends from a deep, rich bottom to acidy, wine-elevated notes at the top. The usual Starbucks carbon tones are pleasantly lost in the expansive complexity of the coffee until the aftertaste, when they surface after the rest of the profile has passed into memory.",,,others,dark,Starbucks Coffee,
Sumatra,Sumatra,"This ingratiating dark roast comes straight at us, forgoing drama and intrigue. Not much Sumatra-style resonance behind its first sweet-pungent impression, but balanced and pleasing.",,,others,dark,Peet's Coffee & Tea,
"San Juanillo Estate, French",not disclosed,"First pungent then complex, the aroma is full of intrigue. We get a bit less in the cup, but given the darkness of the roast what remains is still impressive",,,others,dark,Orleans Coffee Exchange,
Sumatra Gayo Mountain,not disclosed,"Dark fruit (prune?) tones complicate a solid, balanced, dark-roast character. Some carbon at the top of the profile, but good Indonesia richness underneath. The carbon dominates in the aftertaste.",,,others,dark,Uncommon Grounds,
Java,Java,"Hard, high notes surprise in both aroma and cup, persisting into the aftertaste. But if you taste attentively the fundamental, Indonesian matrix of the coffee emerges beneath the sharpness",,,others,dark,Peet's Coffee & Tea,
Celebes Kalossi,not disclosed,"Depending on whether your palate reads the fermented notes as pleasantly fruity or disagreeably cloying, you could love or loath this coffee. If you think you might love it, ignore the rating, which deducts for the ferment. Under the impact of the dark roast the ferment turns lush, almost spicy. Displays the usual Indonesia virtue of solid body.",,,others,dark,Java City,
Kenya AA,Kenya,"One more terrific, full-bore Kenya. The rich, winy acidity carries us up and out, expanding the boundaries of the profile and revealing the usual mouth-filling resonance at the heart of the coffee.",,,others,medium,Willoughby's Coffee & Tea,
Kenya AA,not disclosed,"The characteristically powerful, Burgundy-like Kenya acidity dominates, but if you're patient an immense and subtle richness opens beneath it, assuring a long finish and a resonant aftertaste.",,,others,medium,Café del Mundo,
Ethiopia Yirgacheffe,not disclosed,"Floral and vanilla tones hover in the high-toned acidity, exciting without distracting. The acidity is authoritative despite its floral delicacy and the body surprisingly substantial, although the entire profile loses momentum in the finish.",,,others,medium,Willoughby's Coffee & Tea,
Kenya AA,not disclosed,"For a Kenya, displays a relatively restrained acidity. In another coffee this gentleness might be a fault, but here it reads as understatement, a polite permission for the complexity and echoing dimension of the coffee to emerge without getting upstaged by acidy dramatics.",,,others,medium,Dunn Brothers,
Smaldeel Estate,not disclosed,"The only Zimbabwe in the cupping. Lighter and drier than the best Kenya, with less dimension in the cup and a somewhat more attenuated finish. The pleasure is in the superb top of this coffee, both aroma and acidity levitating with dry fruit and cinnamon tones.",,,others,medium,Café del Mundo,
Ethiopia Yirgacheffe,not disclosed,"Another flower-laced Yirgacheffe, shimmering with rose and lavender notes. Enough acidity to sustain the fruit and flower innuendoes, but rather light-bodied. Some carbon thinness seems to emerge as the coffee cools. Depending on whether you find the very pronounced flower tones a delight or a distraction, this coffee could merit anywhere from an 80 to a 100. I (roughly) split the difference.",,,others,medium,Barnie's Coffee & Tea,
Kenya AA,not disclosed,"The Kenya wine tones are lighter here, more Bordeaux than Burgundy. The profile is also simpler than in many Kenyas, but the high, singing tones of the acidity please until the aftertaste, when they turn slightly astringent.",,,others,medium,Barnie's Coffee & Tea,
Kenya AA,not disclosed,"Carbon tones overlay the sweet fruit fragrances of this dark-roasted Kenya, dampening but not obliterating them. A remarkable body and dimension open underneath the carbon, assuring a long, complex finish.",,,others,dark,Caravali Coffee,
Ethiopia Longberry Harrar,Ethiopia,"Impressive complexity for such a dark-roasted coffee. Prune and vanilla tones grace the aroma, while a fruit-nuanced acidity dominates in the cup. As the coffee cools suggestions of ferment surface in the fruity acidity.",,,others,dark,Oren's Daily Roast,
Kenya AA,Kenya,"Some wine tones survive the dark roast to complicate the acidity. Brought along to a dark roast slowly enough to spare us burned notes, but for a Kenya not a lot of body or dimension either. The pleasure would seem to be the paradox of understated acidity and dark-roast pungency.",,,others,dark,Oren's Daily Roast,
Ethiopia Sidamo,not disclosed,"The high-pitched fruit and vanilla tones in the aroma deepen to herbal wildness in the cup, then to hints of ferment in the finish. Sufficient body but not much dimension.",,,others,medium,Dunn Brothers,
Ethiopia Sidamo,not disclosed,"Pungent, chocolate notes enliven the aroma, but in the cup burned tones dominate. The body is decent, but in the aftertaste the carbon prevails completely.",,,others,dark,Caravali Coffee,
Bridgetown Blend,not disclosed,"An intense coffee, particularly in the nose, but without grace notes or much resonance. Carbon tones dominate, but allow some sweetness and pungency to balance the cup.",,,others,medium,Bridgetown Coffee,
Breakfast Blend,not disclosed,"An exquisitely balanced traditional American-style coffee. The acidity is dry without astringency, alive with slight fruit or wine notes. Enveloped in the matrix of the body, it is always present but never dominant.",,,others,medium,Green Mountain Coffee,
Seattle’s Best Blend, Central and South America,"This coffee gets better as it goes, probably owing to its heavy body. The dark tones of the aroma modulate with increasing power through the cup to a complex finish.","Indonesia,",,others,medium,Seattle's Best Coffee,
Colombian Blend,Colombia,"This coffee is so complex at the top that it positively levitates, alive with sweet, light vanilla tones. In the finish whatever is left of the body vanishes, the vanilla tones fade, but the sweetness lingers.",,,others,medium,Thanksgiving Coffee,
Major Dickason’s Blend,not disclosed,"The body is full, the taste richly pungent. The carbon tones permeate, having definitively chased the acidity south, but they're rich, complex carbon tones, rather than the thin kind that whine at you from the cup.",,,others,dark,Peet's Coffee & Tea,
House Blend,not disclosed,"The acidity doesn't immediately reveal itself in the deep, mouth-filling richness of this coffee, emerging most clearly in the powerful finish. A coffee that, in its understated complexity, seems considerably greater than its parts.",,,others,medium,Backroads Coffee and Tea,
Roaster Boy Blues,not disclosed,"This classic medium-dark coffee gives us solid, mouth-filling dark-roast pungency, though the carbon notes seem to co-opt its sweetness. Some acidity survives the roast, and fills out the top of the profile nicely.",,,others,medium,Dallis Bros. Coffee,
Beanery Blend,not disclosed,A light-medium-roasted blend with power,,,others,medium,The Coffee Beanery,
House Blend,not disclosed,"The rest of the taste profile plays peek-a-boo around dominating carbon tones in this very dark roasted coffee. Nevertheless, the pungent sweetness that constitutes the upside of darker roasts prevails, particularly in the cup.",,,others,dark,Starbucks Coffee,
President’s Private Blend,not disclosed,"Given the medium roast, the carbon notes here are a bit of a surprise. Fortunately, the pungent sweetness also characteristic of darker roasts gives the burned, carbon notes some support, and the acidity holds its own until the finish, when it fades into the carbon.",,,others,medium,Peerless Coffee,
Traditional Roast,not disclosed,"For such a relatively light roast, not particularly acidy. In fact, once past the classically rich, fragrant nose, rather flat. Perhaps the coffee arrived a bit stale. Full-bodied enough to please those who like to ride the classic American roast profile while relegating acidity to the back seat.",,,others,light,Gevalia,
Special Roast,not disclosed,"This coffee arrived pre-ground (not available whole bean), perhaps accounting for its flatness in nose and cup, although some herbal or prune notes survive in the thin, carbon-toned acidity.",,,others,medium,Café Godiva,
