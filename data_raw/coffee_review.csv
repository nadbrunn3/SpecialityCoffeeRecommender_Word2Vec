2991,Pantheon Blend No.1,92,Guatemala; West Java; Colombia.,Starbucks Reserve Roastery,"Seattle, Washington",Medium-Dark,9,8							,8,8,39/47,"Evaluated as espresso. Very discreetly and mildly roast-toned. Ken (93) found the hint of roast fine, maybe even refreshing given all of the bright, lighter-roasted espressos he tastes, but Ethan (91) was not entirely happy with the roasty suggestions. Chocolaty and floral yes, but he also found the blend “bittersweet,” “dry”, even “gritty,” and “lacking complexity overall.” The term “dry” found its way into Ken’s notes as well, but nevertheless he appreciated the chocolate, the caramel, the raisin, the flowers and for him a pleasant hint of anise. True, Ethan did fall in line with Ken when it came to sampling the blend in three parts milk, where both found the chocolate and caramel notes appealing and the floral notes surprisingly clear and persistent.",May 2015,$30.00/16 ounces

Although co-taster Ethan Hill (92) and Ken (92) gave this blend the same rating, Ken was a bit more enthusiastic than Ethan. Both agreed it was a crisply bright, floral-toned espresso (honeysuckle and gardenia for Ethan) with a light, silky mouthfeel. Ethan found a sweet corn undertone in the flavor, Ken a brown sugar note. Both were impressed by the flowers in the “refreshingly resonant” finish (Ethan). In three parts milk Ethan felt the floral brightness clashed a bit with the dairy, though the cup remained “quaintly drinkable”.

Co-taster Ethan Hill (92) and Ken (92) ended with the same score for this blend though their descriptors varied rather dramatically. Ethan’s emphasized flowers and fruit, Ken’s sandalwood and nut, though both cited a fine, elegant dry cacao note. Both found a refined brightness -- “piquant green grape acidity” according to Ethan – and a light though very smooth mouthfeel.

For both Ken (92) and co-taster Ethan Hill (91) high-toned floral notes and rather bright fruit (nectarine, strawberry) distinguished this complex blend. Very light but buoyant, almost effervescent mouthfeel. Along with fruit and flowers Ken identified a brisk roasted cacao-nib note that for him softened to chocolate in an otherwise rather drying finish. In three parts milk Ethan felt the floral character was muted and the acidity too assertive and out of balance; Ken, on the other hand, found the brisk cacao-and-flowers complex rather pleasing in milk.",May 2015,$12.75/12 ounces

""Interesting undomesticated flavors,"" offered another. ""One of those coffees that makes me scratch my head and say 'You're different, but do I really want to know you better?'""

By development I mean the profile transforms in subtle modulations from aroma through aftertaste -- in this case from chocolate and toast notes in aroma and cup to sweet spice tones in finish.

Overall assessments of this sample ranged from bland on the downside to balanced on the upside. Which side of the bland/balanced divide panelists settled on probably depended on their predispositions in regard to the Kona profile generally. Three panelists, including me, detected subtle but pleasant wine tones. Three called the acidity sweet, which I assume was praise as well as description.

6607,Natural Moka – Green,NR,NA,Kaanapali Estate Coffee,"Maui, Hawaii",/,NR,NR,NR,NR,April 1998,"To say this coffee has an atypical profile for a Hawaii coffee is an understatement. Comparing it to the other coffees in the cupping is worse than comparing apples and oranges - more like comparing apples and cocker spaniels. The Kaanapali dry-process Moka is, as one panelist called it, a ""Yemen wannabe."" The trees that produced it are Yemen varietals, and the coffee has been processed in the simple, put-it-out-in-the-sun-to-dry approach used in Yemen and parts of Ethiopia. Which means that, like a Yemen or dry-processed Ethiopia, it is fruity, winy, complex, with a disturbingly lush, overripe aftertaste that lovers of these coffees call gamy or wild and people who don't like Yemen or dry-processed Ethiopia coffees call fermented.Five panelists labeled this coffee fermented and dismissed it with very low scores; three recognized the Yemen/Ethiopia characteristics and treated it like a middle-of-the-road dry-processed Yemen/Ethiopia coffee, giving it scores in the high seventies. Four didn't call it anything but gave it low scores.If this coffee had been presented to the panel in the context of similar dry-processed coffees from Yemen or Ethiopia I don't think it would have provoked quite the same level of criticism. For this reason we're not publishing its scores. However, it did not fare well in the context of this particular cupping.",April 1998,NR

Everyone agreed that it was a soft coffee with medium body. The controversy centered on the flavor complex at the heart of the profile, which elicited characterizations ranging from ""delightfully spicy"" and ""richly chocolaty"" to ""harsh, burned and disturbing"" and ""burned seaweed, or something I had in a sushi bar(!)."" Scores also varied wildly. The nays didn't outnumber the yeas, but the naysayers nayed with more conviction than the yeasayers yeaed, culminating in a low average score. Readers who like low-acid profiles may want to try this coffee anyhow. At a moderately dark brown or full-city roast I suspect the controversial flavor complex will lose its slightly hard edge and turn definitively complex and rich.",April 1998,4.9

Cupper's comments reflect the ambivalence that mild ferment provokes. Almost everyone noted this coffee's luxuriant, wine-like fruitiness. Six cuppers detected a clear defect, however, and five of the six identified the defect (correctly in my view) as ferment, the shadow side of the fruitiness.

Depending on whether you find the very pronounced flower tones a delight or a distraction, this coffee could merit anywhere from an 80 to a 100. I (roughly) split the difference.",March 1997,7
6739,Kenya AA,87,Medium-Dark,Barnie's Coffee & Tea,"Orlando, Florida",45/51,8,7,7,7,March 1997,"The Kenya wine tones are lighter here, more Bordeaux than Burgundy. The profile is also simpler than in many Kenyas, but the high, singing tones of the acidity please until the aftertaste, when they turn slightly astringent.",March 1997,8
6740,Kenya AA,84,Dark,Caravali Coffee,"Kent, Washington",36/41,7,6,7,6,March 1997,"Carbon tones overlay the sweet fruit fragrances of this dark-roasted Kenya, dampening but not obliterating them. A remarkable body and dimension open underneath the carbon, assuring a long, complex finish.",March 1997,7
6741,Ethiopia Longberry Harrar,81,Ethiopia,Oren's Daily Roast,"New York, New York",Dark,7,6,6,6,37/39,"Impressive complexity for such a dark-roasted coffee. Prune and vanilla tones grace the aroma, while a fruit-nuanced acidity dominates in the cup. As the coffee cools suggestions of ferment surface in the fruity acidity.",March 1997,March 1997
6742,Kenya AA,81,Kenya,Oren's Daily Roast,"New York, New York",Dark,6,7,6,6,37/39,"Some wine tones survive the dark roast to complicate the acidity. Brought along to a dark roast slowly enough to spare us burned notes, but for a Kenya not a lot of body or dimension either. The pleasure would seem to be the paradox of understated acidity and dark-roast pungency.",March 1997,March 1997
6743,Ethiopia Sidamo,79,Medium-Dark,Dunn Brothers,"St. Paul, Minnesota",47/50,8,7,6,5,March 1997,"The high-pitched fruit and vanilla tones in the aroma deepen to herbal wildness in the cup, then to hints of ferment in the finish. Sufficient body but not much dimension.",March 1997,8
6744,Ethiopia Sidamo,74,Dark,Caravali Coffee,"Kent, Washington",36/39,6,5,6,5,March 1997,"Pungent, chocolate notes enliven the aroma, but in the cup burned tones dominate. The body is decent, but in the aftertaste the carbon prevails completely.",March 1997,6
6745,Bridgetown Blend,77,Medium-Dark,Bridgetown Coffee,"Portland, Oregon",47/52,8,6,6,7,February 1997,"An intense coffee, particularly in the nose, but without grace notes or much resonance. Carbon tones dominate, but allow some sweetness and pungency to balance the cup.",February 1997,8
6746,Breakfast Blend,90,Medium,Green Mountain Coffee,"Waterbury, Vermont",56/65,7,8,7,8,February 1997,"An exquisitely balanced traditional American-style coffee. The acidity is dry without astringency, alive with slight fruit or wine notes. Enveloped in the matrix of the body, it is always present but never dominant.",February 1997,7
6747,Seattle’s Best Blend,88,"Indonesia, Central and South America",Seattle's Best Coffee,"Seattle, Washington",Medium-Dark,7,6,8,8,47/52,"This coffee gets better as it goes, probably owing to its heavy body. The dark tones of the aroma modulate with increasing power through the cup to a complex finish.",February 1997,February 1997
6748,Colombian Blend,85,Colombia,Thanksgiving Coffee,"Fort Bragg, California",Medium-Dark,7,4,5,8,45/49,"This coffee is so complex at the top that it positively levitates, alive with sweet, light vanilla tones. In the finish whatever is left of the body vanishes, the vanilla tones fade, but the sweetness lingers.",February 1997,February 1997
6749,Major Dickason’s Blend,84,Dark,Peet's Coffee & Tea,"Berkeley, California",36/41,7,4,7,7,February 1997,"The body is full, the taste richly pungent. The carbon tones permeate, having definitively chased the acidity south, but they're rich, complex carbon tones, rather than the thin kind that whine at you from the cup.",February 1997,7
6750,House Blend,84,Medium,Backroads Coffee and Tea,"Hayward, Wisconsin",52/61,7,6,7,8,February 1997,"The acidity doesn't immediately reveal itself in the deep, mouth-filling richness of this coffee, emerging most clearly in the powerful finish. A coffee that, in its understated complexity, seems considerably greater than its parts.",February 1997,7
6751,Roaster Boy Blues,83,Medium-Dark,Dallis Bros. Coffee,"Ozone Park, New York",47/52,7,7,6,7,February 1997,"This classic medium-dark coffee gives us solid, mouth-filling dark-roast pungency, though the carbon notes seem to co-opt its sweetness. Some acidity survives the roast, and fills out the top of the profile nicely.",February 1997,7
6752,Beanery Blend,83,Medium-Light,The Coffee Beanery,"Flushing, Michigan",63/72,8,7,7,7,February 1997,A light-medium-roasted blend with power,February 1997,8
6753,House Blend,81,Dark,Starbucks Coffee,"Seattle, Washington",37/41,7,5,6,8,February 1997,"The rest of the taste profile plays peek-a-boo around dominating carbon tones in this very dark roasted coffee. Nevertheless, the pungent sweetness that constitutes the upside of darker roasts prevails, particularly in the cup.",February 1997,7
6754,President’s Private Blend,75,Medium,Peerless Coffee,"Oakland, California",54/61,6,5,6,5,February 1997,"Given the medium roast, the carbon notes here are a bit of a surprise. Fortunately, the pungent sweetness also characteristic of darker roasts gives the burned, carbon notes some support, and the acidity holds its own until the finish, when it fades into the carbon.",February 1997,6
6755,Traditional Roast,74,Light,Gevalia,"Des Moines, Iowa",68/81,7,8,6,6,February 1997,"For such a relatively light roast, not particularly acidy. In fact, once past the classically rich, fragrant nose, rather flat. Perhaps the coffee arrived a bit stale. Full-bodied enough to please those who like to ride the classic American roast profile while relegating acidity to the back seat.",February 1997,7
6756,Special Roast,68,Medium-Dark,Café Godiva,"Clinton, Connecticut",/44,5,4,4,5,February 1997,"This coffee arrived pre-ground (not available whole bean), perhaps accounting for its flatness in nose and cup, although some herbal or prune notes survive in the thin, carbon-toned acidity.",February 1997,5
